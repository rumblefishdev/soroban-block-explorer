    note: 'Implementation landed in `crates/db-merge` (task 0186): `ingest` / `finalize` / `diff` subcommands cover every table-by-table semantic in this ADR. Runtime infra is two containers (`postgres-merge` + `postgres-snapshot-source`) under the `db-merge` compose profile; the previously-planned simulated multi-laptop test rig (`postgres-truth`, `postgres-laptop-a`, `postgres-laptop-b` + `scripts/db-merge-tests/`) was dropped in favour of operator-driven manual verification — operator generates snapshots themselves via `backfill-runner` / `backfill-bench`, organises them with a numeric filename prefix, ingests in chronological order, and (optionally) maintains their own ground-truth DB to feed `db-merge diff`.'

# ADR 0040: Multi-laptop backfill snapshot merge — schema hazards and playbook

## Context

We plan to parallelise a fresh historical backfill across N laptops. Each
laptop runs `backfill-runner` against its own local Dockerised Postgres on
disjoint ledger ranges (laptop1: 0–2M, laptop2: 2M–4M, …). When all laptops
finish, we will snapshot each DB and merge them into a single canonical
database.

The indexer was designed for a single-writer, monotonic-ledger pipeline; its
upsert semantics are replay-idempotent for the same DB but not for merging
independently-grown DBs. Before we write the merge script we need a complete
picture of:

- which tables are append-only vs upsert and on what conflict target,
- which surrogate keys are DB-local (BIGSERIAL) and which are natural,
- which tables hold "current state" that depends on monotonic ledger ordering,
- where cross-ledger references will dangle when a laptop never sees the
  ledger that created the referent (e.g. an asset minted at L=500k used at
  L=3M),
- which schema invariants will reject naive `INSERT … SELECT` from another
  snapshot (UNIQUE indexes, partial indexes, CHECKs, seed data).

Evidence was gathered by 10 parallel forensic passes over the live DB (`pg_dump`,
`pg_sequences`, `pg_inherits`, `pg_constraint`), the migrations under
`crates/db/migrations/`, the indexer write paths in
`crates/indexer/src/handler/persist/write.rs`, and the runner in
`crates/backfill-runner/src/`.

## Decision

Adopt the merge strategy below. **Do not write a "naive UNION" merge script.**
A correct merge requires per-table semantics, surrogate-id remapping for four
tables (`accounts`, `soroban_contracts`, `nfts`, `transactions`),
natural-key dedup for three more (`assets`, `liquidity_pool_snapshots`,
`operations_appearances`), watermark-based reconciliation for current-state
tables, and seed-aware deduplication.

### Required pre-merge invariants

1. **Identical migration baseline.** On every snapshot:
   `SELECT version, success FROM _sqlx_migrations ORDER BY version;` must match
   exactly across all laptops. Today that is 16 rows ending at
   `20260430000000_invocations_caller_contract`.
2. **Disjoint ledger ranges.** `MIN/MAX(sequence)` from `ledgers` per snapshot
   must not overlap. If they do, switch to `DO NOTHING` for append tables and
   rebuild current-state tables from history.
3. **Same partition layout.** All partitioned tables currently route into
   `*_default` only — there are no explicit RANGE children. Verify identical
   on every laptop before merge; if any laptop ran `db-partition-mgmt` and
   created monthly children, the target must have matching children before
   `ATTACH PARTITION` or before plain `INSERT … SELECT` from the source's
   `*_default`.
4. **Same schema constraint set.** Confirm `ck_assets_identity` (ADR 0038),
   `ck_sia_caller_xor`, and the partial UNIQUEs on `assets` and
   `account_balances_current` are present on every snapshot.

### Surrogate-id remap procedure (four tables with FK referrers + three dedup-only)

Seven sequences exist. **Four** own surrogate keys that are **referenced** by
FKs elsewhere and therefore require a full remap-with-FK-rewrite pass when
merging snapshot N (N ≥ 2) into snapshot 1: `accounts`, `soroban_contracts`,
`nfts`, `transactions`. The other three (`assets`, `liquidity_pool_snapshots`,
`operations_appearances`) have no FK referrers — their surrogate ids still
allocate from per-laptop sequences and therefore still collide on insert, but
the fix is natural-key dedup via existing UNIQUE constraints, not FK
rewriting. All seven are listed below for completeness:

For the four tables with FK referrers, in topological order
(`accounts` → `soroban_contracts` → `nfts` → `transactions`; `soroban_contracts`
must precede `nfts` because `nfts.contract_id` FKs `soroban_contracts.id`):

1. Build a temp table mapping `(natural_key) → (source_id, target_id)` by
   joining source rows against existing target rows, then assigning fresh ids
   (let target's BIGSERIAL allocate via `INSERT … RETURNING`) for newcomers.
2. `INSERT INTO target (…) SELECT … ON CONFLICT (natural_key) DO UPDATE …`
   using each table's existing upsert clause, capturing
   `RETURNING id, natural_key` to learn the target id for every source row.
3. For every dependent table, rewrite the FK column via the map before insert
   (do this in the SELECT, never as a post-insert UPDATE — the partitioned
   tables are huge).

**Full topological merge order** (verified against live DB FK graph, not just
the four sequences above): `_sqlx_migrations` (precondition) → `ledgers` →
`accounts` → `wasm_interface_metadata` → `soroban_contracts` (FKs:
`deployer_id` → accounts, `wasm_hash` → wasm_interface_metadata) → `assets`
(FKs: `issuer_id` → accounts, `contract_id` → soroban_contracts) →
`liquidity_pools` (FKs: `asset_a/b_issuer_id` → accounts) → `nfts` (FKs:
`contract_id` → soroban_contracts, `current_owner_id` → accounts) →
`transactions` (FK: `source_id` → accounts) → `transaction_hash_index` (no
FKs) → all five appearance tables (`operations_appearances` also FKs
`pool_id` → liquidity_pools, so liquidity_pools must precede it) →
`liquidity_pool_snapshots`, `lp_positions`, `account_balances_current`.

For the three dedup-only tables (`assets`, `liquidity_pool_snapshots`,
`operations_appearances`), `INSERT … SELECT … ON CONFLICT … DO NOTHING/UPDATE`
on the existing natural-key UNIQUEs (partial indexes on `assets`,
`uq_lp_snapshots_pool_ledger`, `uq_ops_app_identity`) is sufficient. The
surrogate id of each row will be whatever the target sequence allocates;
because no other table FKs into them, that is fine.

After all merges complete, run
`SELECT setval('<seq>', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM <table>));` for **every** sequence
(all seven) so future inserts on the merged DB don't collide.

### Watermark merges (current-state tables)

`lp_positions`, `account_balances_current`, and `nfts.current_owner_*` are
**Last-Writer-Wins by ledger_sequence**. A naive `INSERT … ON CONFLICT
DO UPDATE SET balance = EXCLUDED.balance` will pick whichever snapshot loaded
last, not whichever has the freshest ledger. Replicate the indexer's clause:

```sql
ON CONFLICT (<natural_key>) DO UPDATE SET
  shares = CASE WHEN EXCLUDED.last_updated_ledger >= target.last_updated_ledger
           THEN EXCLUDED.shares ELSE target.shares END,
  last_updated_ledger = GREATEST(target.last_updated_ledger,
                                 EXCLUDED.last_updated_ledger),
  first_deposit_ledger = LEAST(target.first_deposit_ledger,
                               EXCLUDED.first_deposit_ledger)
```

For `nfts.current_owner_id` / `current_owner_ledger`: do **not** trust either
snapshot's cached values — rebuild after the merge by selecting, per
`(contract_id, token_id)`, the row with `MAX(ledger_sequence, event_order)`
from the merged `nft_ownership`.

### Cross-range dangling references — the hardest problem

`backfill-runner` does **no** cross-ledger lookups. Each laptop parses XDR and
inserts rows in isolation. So for the same logical entity (e.g. account
`G…ABC`), laptop A and laptop B both run their own `INSERT … ON CONFLICT
(account_id) …` and end up with **different surrogate `id` values for the same
StrKey**. This is what forces the remap.

It also means that if laptop B's range has an event referencing a contract
that was _deployed_ in laptop A's range, B will create its own bare
`soroban_contracts` row (the upsert path inserts a stub by `contract_id`,
filling `wasm_hash` / `deployer_id` / `is_sac` lazily). The merge's
`COALESCE`-based union of contract rows is exactly what reconciles this — but
only because the indexer was already designed to tolerate "stub-now,
fill-later" upserts. Confirm before merge that no FK is `NOT NULL` for fields
that may only have been populated on one laptop (today: `deployer_id`,
`wasm_hash`, `contract_type`, `metadata` are all nullable on
`soroban_contracts`; `current_owner_id` is nullable on `nfts`).

### Seed data deduplication

Migration `20260428000000_seed_native_asset_singleton` inserts one row into
`assets` (`asset_type=0`, name='Stellar Lumen'). It runs on every laptop, so
every snapshot has that row. The partial UNIQUE `uidx_assets_native ON
assets((asset_type)) WHERE asset_type = 0` will reject the second copy at
merge time. Use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on the assets merge step (or
explicitly skip the native row when copying from non-canonical snapshots).

### Partition handling

Today every partitioned parent has only a `*_default` child. Two consequences:

- `INSERT … SELECT` from `<source>.<table>_default` into
  `<target>.<table>_default` works without partition gymnastics.
- If a future laptop runs `db-partition-mgmt` and creates monthly children
  while another laptop did not, the merge target must have those children
  too — otherwise rows that fall in a monthly range will be rejected (default
  partition is _exclusive_ of any range covered by an explicit child). Run
  `db-partition-mgmt` on the target to the highest set seen across snapshots
  before merging.

### CASCADE traps

`transactions` is the apex of five `ON DELETE CASCADE` chains
(`operations_appearances`, `transaction_participants`, `soroban_events_appearances`,
`soroban_invocations_appearances`, `nft_ownership`). During the merge, never
`DELETE FROM transactions` to "clean up duplicates" — that wipes the
appearance rows. Use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING/UPDATE` instead.

`nft_ownership` also CASCADEs from `nfts`. Same rule.

**`soroban_contracts.search_vector` is `GENERATED ALWAYS`.** Verified via
`information_schema.columns` — the column is defined as
`tsvector GENERATED ALWAYS AS (to_tsvector('simple',
COALESCE(metadata->>'name','') || ' ' || contract_id)) STORED`. Postgres
forbids explicit values for generated columns on INSERT, so the merge
script's `INSERT INTO soroban_contracts (col_list) SELECT col_list FROM
source` **must omit `search_vector` from `col_list`** (and from any
`SELECT *` shorthand). Postgres will recompute it from the merged `metadata`
and `contract_id` automatically. If you forget, `INSERT … SELECT *` raises
`ERROR: cannot insert a non-DEFAULT value into column "search_vector"`.

**Runtime objects the merge target must already have** (covered by the
"identical migration baseline" precondition, but listed explicitly so a
custom-built target doesn't surprise you): the `pg_trgm` extension (used by
GIN trigram indexes on `assets.asset_code`, `nfts.collection_name`,
`nfts.name`, and `soroban_contracts.search_vector`) and five IMMUTABLE
label functions in `public` — `op_type_name`, `asset_type_name`,
`token_asset_type_name`, `nft_event_type_name`, `contract_type_name` —
created by migration `20260422000000_enum_label_functions`. These are
schema-DDL, not data, so they appear in any `pg_dump --schema-only` of a
laptop that ran the full migration set.

**Postgres partition-FK quirk to expect.** Each of the five appearance-table
_parents_ (and `transaction_participants`, `nft_ownership`) carries **two**
foreign keys to transactions in `pg_constraint`: one to
`transactions(id, created_at)` and one to `transactions_default(id, created_at)`
with a `_fkey1` suffix. Postgres adds the second one automatically when the
default partition is attached. Both are CASCADE and target the same logical
row, so they don't cause double-cascade or duplicate insert validation —
but a merge-script audit query like
`SELECT count(*) FROM pg_constraint WHERE contype='f'` will return roughly
double what you expect. Don't treat this as drift.

## Rationale

The schema was designed for a single-writer pipeline with replay-safe upserts.
The replay-safety almost works for cross-DB merging, with two specific holes:

1. **Surrogate keys are DB-local.** `BIGSERIAL` allocates from a per-DB
   sequence; the same natural key gets different surrogate ids on different
   laptops. Four tables expose surrogate ids that are referenced as FKs
   elsewhere (`accounts`, `soroban_contracts`, `nfts`, `transactions`), so
   the merge cannot just `INSERT … SELECT *` — it must rewrite the FK column
   on every dependent row. This is the single biggest source of complexity
   in the merge script and the reason a "naive `pg_dump | pg_restore`"
   approach is wrong.
2. **Current-state tables clobber by load order, not by ledger order.** The
   indexer's upserts already use `last_updated_ledger` watermarks, but a
   merge script that omits them will pick whichever snapshot was loaded last,
   silently corrupting balances and LP positions when ranges overlap or when
   a row from a later range is loaded before a row from an earlier range.

Everything else (append-only tables, partitioned appearance tables with
natural-key UNIQUEs, monotonic columns) merges cleanly under the rules
already encoded in the indexer's `ON CONFLICT` clauses.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Single-laptop sequential backfill

**Description:** Skip the parallel approach; one machine runs the full
historical backfill in ledger order.

**Pros:**

- No merge script needed.
- `last_updated_ledger` watermarks behave identically to production, no
  reconciliation step.
- Surrogate-id sequences are globally unique by construction.

**Cons:**

- Linear in wall-clock time — the whole point of using N laptops is to cut
  this by ~N.

**Decision:** REJECTED — the parallelism win is the explicit goal.

### Alternative 2: Logical replication / one shared DB

**Description:** Run a single Postgres on a shared host; every laptop's
`backfill-runner` writes to the same DB.

**Pros:**

- No merge step at all.
- Surrogate-id allocation stays serial.

**Cons:**

- Defeats "local Docker DB per laptop" — needs network round-trip on every
  insert. UNNEST batches help but won't recover the order of magnitude lost.
- WAL contention on hot tables (`accounts`, `soroban_contracts`, `assets`)
  would pin throughput to single-writer levels anyway.

**Decision:** REJECTED — undermines the perf goal.

### Alternative 3: Naive `pg_dump | pg_restore` with `--data-only`

**Description:** Dump each laptop's data and restore one after another into a
fresh target.

**Pros:**

- Trivially simple to run.

**Cons:**

- Surrogate-id collisions on every BIGSERIAL primary key. The second restore
  fails on PK conflict for `accounts`, `soroban_contracts`, `transactions`,
  etc.
- Even if collisions were resolved by offsetting sequences, FKs would still
  point to the wrong rows because the same StrKey gets different ids per
  laptop.
- No watermark logic for current-state tables — naive restore order
  determines `account_balances_current` values.

**Decision:** REJECTED — produces a structurally inconsistent DB.

### Alternative 4: Use natural keys everywhere, drop surrogate ids

**Description:** Refactor the schema so every table uses natural keys (StrKey
for accounts/contracts, hash for transactions). Then merge becomes UNION ALL

- dedup.

**Pros:**

- Merging is trivial.

**Cons:**

- Reverses ADRs 0026 (accounts surrogate) and 0030 (contracts surrogate),
  which were taken specifically because BIGINT joins are dramatically faster
  than VARCHAR(56) joins on the partitioned appearance tables.
- Touches every read path and every index.
- Out of scope for a one-off backfill.

**Decision:** REJECTED — too invasive for a transient merge problem.

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- The merge script has a complete, reviewed map of every conflict target,
  every surrogate-id remap, and every watermark-sensitive column before code
  is written.
- Future readers can answer "what does this table do at merge time?" from a
  single document instead of re-reading 14 INSERT sites in `write.rs`.
- The required pre-merge invariants (identical migration set, disjoint
  ledger ranges, identical partition layout) are stated explicitly so the
  script can assert them at start instead of failing late.

### Negative

- The merge script is non-trivial — at minimum four remap passes (`accounts`,
  `soroban_contracts`, `nfts`, `transactions`) with FK rewrites in every
  dependent SELECT, plus natural-key dedup passes for `assets`,
  `liquidity_pool_snapshots`, `operations_appearances`. Plan for it
  accordingly.
- A correctness regression in the indexer's ON CONFLICT clauses now has a
  second blast radius (the merge script depends on them being right).
- `nfts.current_owner_*` reconciliation requires a post-merge scan over the
  full `nft_ownership` event log — measurable cost on full-history merges.
