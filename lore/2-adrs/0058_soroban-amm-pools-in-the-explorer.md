# ADR 0058: Soroban AMM pools in the explorer

## Context

Classic (CAP-38) liquidity pools are host-maintained ledger entries the
explorer has always indexed. Soroban AMM pools are ordinary contracts: the
ledger holds no pool table, no reserve column, no share registry — everything
is contract-authored state and events, per protocol. Issue #405 asked for
Aquarius and Soroswap. Task 0374 built the router family (Aquarius's shape)
end to end, depth-first: only what this family needs, measured on the full
mainnet population at every step.

## Decisions

### 1. Discovery is shape-driven, per deployment — never address-driven

Pools enter the registry by decoding every `add_pool` event that satisfies the
registration shape, from ANY deployment (`detect_pool_registrations` in
`xdr-parser`). A hardcoded router address list loses ~6% of live pools
(measured); a shape decode loses none and picks up new routers with no code
change. The registering router is stored as `liquidity_pools.deployment_id`
(contract surrogate).

**Protocol labels are attribution, resolved at read time** from
`deployment_id` against a verified-operator list in the API. Two live routers
share Aquarius's WASM byte-for-byte with all seven admin roles disjoint
(measured), so code identity does not establish operator identity: the
vendor-documented router labels `aquarius`, the other stays indexed and
UNLABELLED. A label fix is a code change, never an UPDATE.

### 2. One pool dimension, two id worlds

Soroban pools are rows in the same `liquidity_pools` table
(`pool_kind = 1`), because the list endpoint must union both worlds and a
dimension shares its grain (one row = one pool). New columns: `pool_kind`,
`legs Array(Int64)` (surrogates per leg in a PER-KIND id space — 3- and
4-leg stable pools exist, a pair cannot hold them), `deployment_id`,
`pool_type_raw` (verbatim event sym — three vendor vocabularies exist for one
shape; folding them is read-time interpretation). Deliberately NOT columns:
`subpool_salt` and `init_args` (beyond the fee) are never materialised — the
`add_pool` event sits complete and forever in `soroban_events`, extract on
demand; and the share-token relation lives ONLY in `pool_instance_state` (a
registry column was dead-on-arrival and removed in the distillation pass).

The 32 id bytes of a soroban pool are a CONTRACT address payload. The API
renders them as `C...` and accepts both `L...` and `C...` on pool routes; an
`L...` render of contract bytes would be a well-formed WRONG key, so it is
never minted.

### 3. Reserves are ledger STATE, one row per (pool, ledger) — `pool_state_changes`

Event arithmetic failed its oracle on 6/49 pools (measured), so reserves come
from ledger-entry changes, written to `pool_state_changes
(pool_id, ledger_sequence, reserves Array(Int128), plane_id)` — sort key
`(pool, ledger)`, ONE deterministic row per pair, collapsed at parse time in
ledger apply order. Two on-chain layouts feed one table:

- **fungible** pools (constant/stable) write `PoolData[pool]` on the
  deployment's shared _plane_ contract — the vector is stored VERBATIM
  (per-tick tails exist; readers slice by leg count, never by vector
  length);
- **concentrated** pools write `Reserve0`/`Reserve1` on their own instance —
  the plane holds their `PoolData` only at registration (discovered by a
  bidirectional anti-test against `update_reserves` events).

**The grain decision was REVERSED once, deliberately (2026-08-30), before
any production DDL existed.** The first design kept every intra-ledger write
(up to 12/ledger measured) and therefore needed an `application_order` key
component — a hash-surrogate order had returned an intermediate write as
"latest" on 127 of 1,410 real pairs. The full-pipeline e2e then showed the
per-write grain had NO consumer: the anti-tests compare at ledger grain, the
API shows only the latest state, and intra-ledger history is permanently
reconstructible from `soroban_events` (`update_reserves` per action) — so
storing intermediates duplicated the events. Collapsing to the classic
mechanism (last image in apply order, the `dedup_final_pool_snapshots`
twins) removes the ordering-column class of bugs, restores the 0356
LIMIT-1/no-FINAL invariant here too, and makes the future snapshot
unification a plain union of IDENTICAL grains. Re-verified after the
collapse on real windows: rows == pairs 1,415/1,415, values vs events
1,414/1,414, live-chain spot checks exact. Resurrect the per-write design
only for a consumer that needs intra-ledger STATE without event replay.

This table is deliberately named WITHOUT a family prefix: it is the target
state-fact shape, and classic snapshot history would join INTO it if the two
snapshot models ever unify — never the reverse. The classic
`liquidity_pool_snapshots` stays as-is until that unification (trigger
recorded in task 0374).

### 4. What a pool declares about itself is a SIDE table — `pool_instance_state`

A pool's instance storage carries its `TokenShare`, its `Plane` and its
`Router`, and the pool contract is the ledger-authenticated OWNER of that
entry — so nothing there can be forged by a third party. Those declarations
live in `pool_instance_state (pool_id, plane_id, share_token_id,
derived_at_ledger)` — the `asset_sac` pattern — because the deriving path
knows only what one instance says, and a partial row written into the RMT
registry would replace the full registration on merge. Versioned by sighting
ledger so a share-token migration (13 pools re-pointed theirs, measured)
converges on the newest, matching on-chain `share_id()`.

The share-token half is cross-checked by the SEP-41 mint rule from deposit
transactions, which is a demoted cross-check, not a source. Concentrated pools
mint nothing, so their `share_token_id` is a structural `0`; their positions
are NFTs (future work). `plane_id` is always populated — `Plane` is the key an
instance must carry to be recognised as a pool at all.

**`Router` is NOT guaranteed** (read from chain 2026-09-01, correcting an
earlier generalisation): five of the ten deployments run an older contract
whose instance carries `Plane`, `TokenShare` and reserves but no `Router` key —
23 real pools. The original rule ("carries both") was measured on live
creations and generalised to the whole population. Nothing states a guarantee
either way: the protocol docs say nothing about trusting entry contents, the
vendor's docs describe the roles without promising the key, and the vendor's
source is unreachable. So those pools are indexed and their registrations
accepted UNVERIFIED rather than refused — a missing key is an older contract
version, not a forgery. Residual, stated rather than hidden: the registry row
of a pool that declares no router is forgeable; every such pool measured is a
dead deployment with no flow event ever.

**AMENDED 2026-09-01 (review of PR #438).** This decision originally scoped the
table to the share-token relation alone (`pool_share_tokens`). It now carries
`plane_id` as well, and the table is renamed accordingly, because the two facts
come from ONE authenticated source read in one pass — and because `plane_id` is
what makes reserve provenance checkable. A plane entry names its pool in a key
payload the writing contract chooses freely, so any contract can publish
reserves under a victim pool's id; reads of `pool_state_changes` keep only rows
whose `plane_id` matches what the pool itself declares here. The same review
added the symmetric write-side rule — a registration is accepted when the
named pool's instance declares the emitter as its `Router`; an instance with
no `Router` key at all (five older deployments, 23 pools, read from chain
2026-09-01) is accepted UNVERIFIED with a warn, because a missing key is an
older contract version, not evidence of a forgery, and dropping a real pool
is the failure the reject taxonomy exists to prevent. A second side table
was considered and rejected: the facts share a source, a grain and a version
clock, so one table is the honest shape. Free to do, since nothing had
deployed.

A Soroban token IS an LP share exactly when it appears in this relation —
never an `assets` column (ADR/task 0496: `AssetFamily` stays
native/classic/soroban; "LP share" is a relation, not an asset type).

### 5. API: one list, explicit refusals, no misleading zeros

`GET /liquidity-pools` returns both kinds discriminated by `pool_kind`;
soroban rows publish `legs[]` (resolved through the `asset_sac` facet or the
bespoke-token `assets` row; an unresolvable leg surfaces as
`family: "unresolved"`, never a plausible empty asset) and null out the pair
fields. Values with the wrong population's truth go ABSENT, not zero:
`participant_count` is null on soroban list rows (their participants are
share-token holders in `balances`, answered per pool by the participants
endpoint). The chart and activity feeds serve BOTH kinds behind one URL,
branched per kind inside the handler: the classic arm keeps its snapshot /
`lp_operation_amounts` sources, the soroban arm reads the pool's own
`trade` / `deposit_liquidity` / `withdraw_liquidity` events out of
`soroban_events` (activity: per-leg signed raw amounts in `leg_amounts`,
scaled client-side by each leg's on-chain decimals; the actor is the
transaction's source, never the event's trader topic — for routed trades
that names the router contract) and folds reserves from
`pool_state_changes` with the same prices series the classic chart joins
(bespoke tokens price under `asset_kind = 'contract'`; a bucket holding an
unpriceable trade reports null volume, never a partial sum). The one
refusal left is participants on a pool with no known share token (e.g. a
concentrated pool whose positions are not share-token balances) — an
explanatory 400 instead of a confidently empty list. Soroban participant
`shares` display scaled by the share
token's on-chain decimals, or null when the token never published them — an
unknown scale must not render raw units as if scaled.

## Consequences

- A new AMM protocol needs: nothing (registration + reserves flow in via the
  shape decode and state extraction) — plus a one-line verified-operator
  label if attribution is established. Protocols with different shapes
  (e.g. Soroswap) add their own detector/adapter, same tables.
- The union list is served by one query; per-kind branching exists only in
  enrichment and the per-pool feeds. Every pool-history endpoint carries a
  per-kind branch until the snapshot models unify — a named, accepted cost.
- The soroban chart folds buckets in Rust (bounded per-pool row counts)
  rather than in generated SQL — the N-leg × bucket carry logic stays unit-
  testable; the price-carry ceiling (48 h) and the reserve carry are the
  same rules the classic chart applies.
- `balances` is read asset-first by the soroban participants endpoint (full
  scan, measured 121.5M rows / 71 ms); a skip index on `asset_id` is the
  upgrade path if it gets hot.
