# ADR 0008: Error envelope and pagination shape for the HTTP API

**Related:**

- [Task 0042: OpenAPI/Swagger infrastructure setup](../1-tasks/active/0042_FEATURE_openapi-swagger-infrastructure.md)
- [ADR 0005: Rust-only backend API](./0005_rust-only-backend-api.md)

---

## Context

Task 0042 introduces the M1 OpenAPI infrastructure. Before any M2 endpoint modules (tasks 0043–0053) are wired in, two cross-cutting shapes need to be fixed once and then honoured uniformly:

1. **Error envelope** — the JSON body that every failing request returns
2. **Pagination envelope** — the wrapper that every list endpoint uses to expose its items

Both shapes are load-bearing. Changing them after M2 endpoints ship is a breaking change for every frontend consumer, every external SDK client, and every integration test. Picking them in a vacuum inside a single task's implementation notes is not enough — the decision deserves an explicit ADR so future contributors can trace the reasoning, and so changes go through the ADR lifecycle (superseded-by) rather than silent drift.

---

## Decision

Adopt the following Rust shapes, defined in `crates/api/src/openapi/schemas.rs` and exposed as OpenAPI schema components via `ApiDoc::components`:

```rust
pub struct ErrorEnvelope {
    pub code: String,                          // stable machine-readable key
    pub message: String,                       // human-readable description
    pub details: Option<serde_json::Value>,    // optional structured context
}

pub struct PageInfo {
    pub cursor: Option<String>,   // opaque next-page cursor, None on last page
    pub limit: u32,               // page size that produced `data`
    pub has_more: bool,           // true iff further pages exist
}

pub struct Paginated<T: ToSchema> {
    pub data: Vec<T>,
    pub page: PageInfo,
}
```

Every failure response body across all M2 endpoints must serialise to `ErrorEnvelope`. Every list endpoint must return `Paginated<T>` for some concrete `T`. Mixing shapes (e.g. one endpoint returning a bare JSON array) is forbidden without a follow-up ADR superseding this one.

**Status codes** are not part of this ADR — the envelope is the response _body_, status codes follow normal HTTP semantics.

---

## Rationale

### Error envelope

- **Stable `code`** is the contract surface clients key off. Changing `message` wording is not a breaking change; changing `code` is. This split mirrors the pattern used by Stripe, GitHub, and Slack APIs, where message text is localised/edited freely while codes are versioned.
- **Optional `details`** as untyped JSON keeps the shape open for field-level validation errors, rate-limit metadata, and future structured context without requiring a new envelope version.
- The shape is **intentionally minimal** — three fields covers every known use case in the explorer API and leaves no room for bikeshedding. See "Alternatives" for why we did not adopt RFC 7807.

### Pagination

- **Cursor-based, not offset-based.** The explorer indexes a live ledger stream — new records arrive continuously. Offset pagination over a growing collection produces skipped and duplicated items as pages shift between requests. Cursor pagination gives stable listings regardless of stream advances.
- **Opaque cursor string.** Encoded as whatever the endpoint needs (base64-encoded `(id, ts)`, sequence number, etc.) — opacity means the backend can change the encoding later without a client migration.
- **`has_more` boolean on the server side**, not computed from `len(data) == limit`. Explicit `has_more` lets the server answer definitively and handles edge cases (page exactly at the end) without client-side heuristics.
- **Single generic `Paginated<T>`**. One shape for every list endpoint means one TypeScript type on the frontend, one SDK helper, one error-handling branch. DRY wins here because the shape is genuinely identical everywhere.
- Aligns with **Stellar Horizon API** conventions (our upstream data source), reducing cognitive load for users coming from Horizon.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: RFC 7807 `application/problem+json`

**Description:** Use the IETF standard problem-details format with `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`, `instance` fields.

**Pros:**

- IETF standard, widely recognised
- `type` as a URI gives a canonical link to error documentation
- Plays well with JSON schema validators that understand problem+json

**Cons:**

- Five required fields where three suffice
- `type` URI discipline is real overhead — either we maintain a docs site with one page per error type, or we fake it with `about:blank` and lose the value
- `status` field duplicates the HTTP status code, inviting drift between headers and body
- `instance` is almost never useful — we don't generate per-request identifiers anyway
- Most public API consumers do not actually check `Content-Type: application/problem+json` and treat it as regular JSON, so the formal benefit is lost

**Decision:** REJECTED — overkill for a block explorer API. The simpler `{code, message, details}` shape is easier to produce, easier to consume, and avoids the `type` URI maintenance burden.

### Alternative 2: Offset-based pagination (`?offset=100&limit=50`)

**Description:** Classic offset pagination as used by most CRUD APIs.

**Pros:**

- Trivial to implement on top of SQL `LIMIT/OFFSET`
- Clients can jump to arbitrary pages (`?page=5`)
- Familiar to every backend developer

**Cons:**

- **Unstable under concurrent writes.** The ledger stream is append-only but constantly advancing — offset 100 means something different on every request
- Skipped/duplicated items when new records land between consecutive page fetches
- Deep offsets are expensive in PostgreSQL (`OFFSET 10000` scans and discards 10k rows)
- Does not match Stellar Horizon's API idiom

**Decision:** REJECTED — the instability is a correctness issue for an explorer, not a theoretical concern. Cursor pagination is the right pattern for append-only streams.

### Alternative 3: Per-endpoint bespoke envelopes

**Description:** Let each endpoint define its own list response shape — e.g. `TransactionListResponse { transactions: Vec<Transaction>, next_cursor: Option<String> }` rather than `Paginated<Transaction>`.

**Pros:**

- Each endpoint is self-contained
- Frontend type names are domain-specific (`TransactionList` vs `Paginated<Transaction>`)

**Cons:**

- 20+ endpoint types to maintain
- Every pagination bugfix needs to land in 20+ places
- Frontend cannot write a single paginated-list hook; needs one per endpoint
- Drift over time is inevitable without enforcement

**Decision:** REJECTED — the uniformity gain is worth far more than the minor type-name verbosity cost. utoipa handles generic schemas correctly in utoipa 5.

## Consequences

### Positive

- One shape, one TypeScript type, one error-handling branch on the frontend
- Pagination bugs fix in one place
- Documented decision: future contributors (and future sessions) can trace why these shapes look the way they do
- OpenAPI spec validates handler return types against these shapes at compile time — drift is caught at build

### Negative

- Changing either shape later is a breaking change and requires a new ADR superseding this one
- `details: Option<serde_json::Value>` loses some OpenAPI schema fidelity — `details` is documented as "arbitrary JSON". Consumers who want structured validation of a specific error's `details` need to inspect the `code` first
- Cursor pagination means no arbitrary jumping — clients can only advance through pages. Considered acceptable for an explorer where most users consume newest-first streams anyway
