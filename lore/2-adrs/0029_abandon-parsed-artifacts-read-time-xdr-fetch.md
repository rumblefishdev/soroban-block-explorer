      Drafted following a team architectural decision to pivot from
      pre-parsed S3 artifacts to read-time XDR fetch against the public

---

## Context

ADRs 0011 / 0012 / 0018 established the "DB = lightweight index, our S3 =
heavy parsed JSON" pattern. ADR 0028 (proposed, now superseded) specified
the concrete shape of that artifact. Task 0146 began implementing it
(ADR 0028 + scaffold merged via PR #100).

In a team meeting on 2026-04-21 the architectural direction changed:

> No parsed-ledger S3 bucket on our side. If an endpoint needs data that
> is not in the DB (heavy fields like memo, signatures, raw XDR blobs,
> full event topics + data), fetch the raw `.xdr.zst` from the public
> Stellar archive (`s3://aws-public-blockchain/v1.1/stellar/ledgers/pubnet/`)
> and parse it inline when assembling the response.

Task 0145 (owner: Karol) rescoped independently on the same day
(commit `ebb307c` — "pivot scope to postgres sink") along the same
direction: Postgres sink via `indexer::handler::process::process_ledger`,
no artifact emission, no dependency on task 0146. This ADR records the
decision, its consequences, and the remaining coordination (cancel
tasks 0146 and 0147, spawn task 0150, remove the `xdr-parser::artifact`
scaffold).

### What changes

- **No parsed-ledger artifact format** — the shape and storage described
  by ADR 0028 is abandoned.
- **No dedicated S3 bucket** for parsed artifacts on our side.
- **Read path** for E3 (`/transactions/:hash`) and E14
  (`/contracts/:id/events`) — any "heavy field" not persisted in the ADR
  0027 DB is fetched from the public Stellar archive at request time and
  parsed in-process before inclusion in the response.
- **Write path** — unchanged in principle: the indexer (`process_ledger`
  → `persist_ledger`) parses `LedgerCloseMeta` and writes the light
  column set into the ADR 0027 schema. The only thing that goes away is
  the subsequent artifact emission.

### What does not change

- **ADR 0027 DB schema** (18 tables). The schema and its endpoint
  realizability analysis remain intact.
- **`crates/xdr-parser`** — still the sole XDR parsing path (ADR 0004).
  Its role expands: used both at ingest and, for a small number of
  endpoints, at read time.
- **Galexie infrastructure** — raw ledger arrivals continue to land on
  the Galexie bucket and trigger the existing indexer lambda (from task
  0033).
- **Enrichment pipelines** — tokens, NFTs, LP TVL/volume/fee_revenue
  (tasks 0124 / 0125 / 0135 / 0138 / future) still fill their DB
  columns via their own schedules.

---

## Decision

1. **Cancel the parsed-ledger artifact storage track.** No bucket, no
   `.json.zst` files, no storage format spec. ADR 0028 is superseded.

2. **Cancel task 0146** (shared parsed-ledger artifact core) —
   superseded by the new write-path + read-path split (tasks 0149 +
   0150). Remove the `crates/xdr-parser/src/artifact/` module scaffold
   landed by PR #100.

3. **Cancel task 0147** (live Galexie onPut lambda emitting artifact) —
   the existing indexer lambda (task 0033) already calls
   `process_ledger` → `persist_ledger`; once task 0149 fills
   `persist_ledger`, the lambda writes to DB with no additional
   infrastructure. No separate task needed.

4. **Ingest goes directly to DB.** Task 0149 replaces the stubbed
   `persist_ledger` body with the full ADR 0027 write. The existing
   Galexie lambda and the new backfill runner (task 0145 per Karol's
   rescope — `crates/backfill-runner/`, Postgres sink, coexisting with
   `backfill-bench`) both call the same `process_ledger` entry point
   and rely on 0149 for the DB work.

5. **Heavy-field reads go to the public archive.** Spawn task 0150:
   API-side XDR fetcher for endpoints E3 and E14:

   ```
   API request → DB lookup for light fields + ledger_sequence
              → public Stellar S3 GetObject (unsigned)
              → xdr_parser::decompress_zstd + deserialize_batch
              → xdr_parser::extract_* (subset matching endpoint needs)
              → merge heavy fields into response JSON
   ```

6. **Caching is deferred.** Add cache only if measured hot-path latency
   proves insufficient. Spawn a dedicated cache task (ID assigned at spawn time) at that point, not before.

7. **Production backfill gated on read-path validation.** The
   production run of task 0145 (not its implementation) waits for task
   0150 completion and E3/E14 endpoint integration tests against a
   small live sample. Rationale: committing weeks of compute before
   end-to-end validation is avoidable risk. Task 0145 implementation
   itself is not blocked.

---

## Rationale

### Reducing S3 storage cost (primary driver)

The main argument raised in the meeting: mirroring the Soroban-era
corpus as `parsed_ledger_{seq}.json.zst` on our S3 meant multi-TB
accumulation over tens of millions of ledgers, plus lifecycle /
replication overhead, for data that is already globally available on
the public Stellar archive. The direct storage bill and the indirect
operational cost of managing it were the dominant reason to drop the
artifact bucket. The other points below reinforce the decision but
would not by themselves have overturned ADR 0028.

### Simpler storage graph

One system of record (the DB) instead of two (DB + parsed S3). Fewer
failure modes, fewer consistency concerns (a DB row and a JSON blob
cannot disagree because the blob does not exist).

### Public archive is already canonical

Stellar Dev Foundation publishes `.xdr.zst` for every ledger on
`aws-public-blockchain/v1.1/stellar/ledgers/pubnet/`. Mirroring that
corpus under our account adds cost without adding capability — the
upstream is the authoritative source and is globally accessible.

### Lower operational surface

No parsed-ledger bucket means: no bucket IAM policy, no lifecycle rules,
no cross-region replication decisions, no artifact-schema versioning /
re-emit drills. The ADR 0028 discipline (byte-for-byte determinism,
additive-only v1, etc.) evaporates along with the stored format.

### Parser reuse at read time

`crates/xdr-parser` already provides `decompress_zstd`,
`deserialize_batch`, and the full `extract_*` suite. Using it at read
time for E3/E14 is a straightforward invocation against bytes fetched
at request time. No new parsing code, just a new call site.

### Predictable M1 critical path

M1 requires all 22 endpoints to function. 20 of them read only from DB
and are unaffected by this pivot. The remaining 2 (E3, E14) consume the
public archive at request time. Task 0150 carries that specific work.

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- **One storage layer.** DB-only persistence eliminates a class of
  cross-store consistency bugs.
- **Zero mirror cost.** No TB-scale accumulation of `.json.zst` files
  in our S3.
- **Faster M1 integration path.** Existing indexer lambda + existing
  `backfill-bench` + new `backfill-runner` (task 0145) all reduce to
  "fill `persist_ledger` body" (task 0149). No new lambda to deploy,
  no new bucket to provision.
- **xdr-parser is load-bearing at read time.** Natural reuse; further
  optimisation of the parser benefits both paths.
- **Decoupled enrichment.** Tokens / NFTs / LP metrics continue on
  their own tracks; unaffected by the pivot.

### Negative

- **Public S3 dependency on the hot path for E3 and E14.** Two
  endpoints become dependent on the availability and latency of
  `aws-public-blockchain`. Mitigation: timeouts, graceful fallback to
  "details unavailable, retry shortly", observability on upstream
  health.
- **Latency budget tightens for E3 / E14.** Each detail request now
  incurs a public S3 GET (~20-100 ms) + zstd decompress (~5-20 ms) +
  XDR deserialize + targeted `extract_*` (~10-50 ms). Without caching,
  baseline p95 will be measurably higher than a DB-only endpoint.
- **Rate limits and egress accounting shift upstream.** High-traffic
  detail endpoints hit the public bucket repeatedly. If sustained
  traffic or cost proves material, a dedicated cache task (cache layer) is the
  follow-up.
- **Lost work on ADR 0028 and task 0146.** The artifact shape spec
  and the scaffold are not reusable in the new architecture. Value
  salvaged: field-level shape thinking informs per-endpoint response
  contracts via xdr-parser; design archaeology preserved in git
  history.
- **M1 sequencing constraint.** Production backfill run (the execution
  of task 0145, not its implementation) waits for task 0150
  completion. Implementation can proceed in parallel with 0149 and 0150.

## Alternatives considered

### Alt 1: Continue with ADR 0028 artifact storage

**Description:** Complete task 0146 (PR 2/3), stand up a parsed-ledger
bucket, have Galexie lambda + backfill CLI emit `.json.zst`, run DB
ingester off those artifacts.

**Pros:** Predictable read-path latency (bucket is our infra, close to
API). Replay-friendly (re-parse with newer parser = rebuild corpus).

**Cons:** Multi-TB mirror storage; two write paths with synchronization
burden; artifact-schema versioning overhead; duplicate effort when the
public archive already hosts the raw data.

**Decision:** REJECTED.

### Alt 2: Serve everything from DB (no read-time XDR parse)

**Description:** Extend ADR 0027 schema to persist every heavy field
that E3 / E14 need.

**Pros:** All endpoints become pure DB reads. No public S3 dependency.

**Cons:** DB size explodes — the original motivation for S3 offload
(ADR 0011) re-applies here. Memo blobs, XDR envelopes, raw event
topics + data, signatures across millions of ledgers are the exact
payload the "light DB" principle was designed to keep out.

**Decision:** REJECTED.

### Alt 3: Hybrid — cache parsed blobs on our S3 lazily

**Description:** On first E3 / E14 hit, fetch from public archive,
parse, cache derived blob on our S3 for later requests.

**Pros:** Read latency improves after first hit; reduces public-archive
load.

**Cons:** Reintroduces an artifact bucket with its own lifecycle
concerns and consistency questions. Defers rather than removes the
complexity of ADR 0028.

**Decision:** DEFERRED — treat as a potential implementation of the
dedicated cache-layer follow-up task (ID assigned at spawn) once
measurement justifies; not committed as the default approach.

## Sequencing implications

| Phase           | Work                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0               | Accept ADR 0029; cancel tasks 0146 + 0147; remove `xdr-parser::artifact` scaffold; spawn task 0150               |
| 1               | Task 0149 — implement `persist_ledger` body against ADR 0027 schema                                              |
| 2               | Task 0145 implementation — `crates/backfill-runner/` Postgres sink CLI, coexisting with `backfill-bench`         |
| 2               | Task 0150 — API-side XDR fetcher + `extract_*` invocation for E3 / E14                                           |
| 3               | Integration test: live Galexie ingest of a sample range; API endpoint checks pass for light **and** heavy fields |
| 4               | Production backfill run (task 0145 execution, not implementation)                                                |
| 5 (conditional) | Cache-layer task (ID assigned at spawn) if measured latency requires                                             |

Phases 1 and 2 run in parallel. Phase 4 is gated on Phase 3
completion. Karol's rescope of 0145 (commit `ebb307c`) is consistent
with this sequencing and requires no further change beyond its own
merge.

---

## Open questions

1. **Public archive key-construction**: Galexie/public-archive keys
   use a partition directory + file naming scheme. The 8-char hex
   component is derived from reverse ledger ordering (`u32::MAX -
ledger` per `xdr-parser::parse_s3_key` docs; `u32::MAX -
partition_start` for partition directories per
   `backfill-bench::Partition::from_ledger`), while the file name
   carries the `{start}[-{end}].xdr.zst` range. Task 0150 needs a
   deterministic forward map
   (`ledger_sequence → partition_dir/file_key`) or a narrow S3 list;
   `xdr-parser` already has the reverse parse — verify symmetry
   during 0150 scoping.
2. **Timeout and fallback for public S3 GET**: what p99 latency budget
   does the API set before returning "heavy fields temporarily
   unavailable"? Task 0150 open.
3. **Observability**: metrics on public-archive GET latency, parse
   time, cache hit rate (once the cache task lands). Scope in 0150.
4. **Lost enrichment insurance**: without a parsed corpus, a parser
   bug discovered in production requires re-running ingest against the
   public archive. Acceptable given the archive is upstream-authoritative;
   documented here as an acknowledged operational property.

## Postscript — Appearance-index ordering contract (task 0192)

[Task 0192](../1-tasks/active/0192_BUG_operations-appearances-ordering-not-apply-order.md)
clarifies a corollary of this ADR that was implicit and got broken: the
boundary between **what lives in the DB** (typed identity columns + amount
fold count) and **what lives in XDR** (per-op detail). For ordering
specifically:

- The DB stores **only** the canonical apply-order position per appearance
  row (`operations_appearances.application_order SMALLINT`, 1-based, MIN-fold
  across collapsed envelope ops). It does NOT store the per-op details —
  those continue to live in `envelope_xdr` and are re-materialised at read
  time per this ADR.
- The DB **does not** rely on `oa.id` (BIGSERIAL ingest artefact) for any
  semantic ordering contract. The pre-task-0192 implicit assumption that
  `oa.id` is monotone with apply order was empirically false (the indexer's
  HashMap-keyed identity aggregation produced alphabetic-by-asset_code INSERT
  order); endpoint 03 Statement C now orders by
  `oa.application_order NULLS LAST, oa.id`.
- The API DTO surfaces `application_order` on `OperationItem`. The XDR
  overlay (`XdrOperationDto.application_order` from
  `xdr_parser::extract_operations`) carries the same 1-based per-tx
  position, so light + heavy can be joined on this key.

This generalises to all appearance-index tables (cf. ADRs 0033 / 0034 for
events / invocations): identity-fold + first-appearance position is the
canonical ordering contract; raw row IDs are internal artefacts and MUST
NOT be exposed by APIs as ordering keys.
