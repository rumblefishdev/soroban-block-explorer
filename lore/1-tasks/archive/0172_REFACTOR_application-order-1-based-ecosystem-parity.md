# REFACTOR: switch application_order from 0-based to 1-based for Stellar ecosystem parity

## Summary

`transactions.application_order` and `operations_appearances.application_order`
are stored 0-based by the indexer. The rest of the Stellar ecosystem
(Horizon `paging_token`, stellar-core history records, stellar.expert,
SDK) uses 1-based application_order. Switch to 1-based at the indexer
boundary, update ADR 0028, and reindex. Mainnet backfill has not yet
started — this is the cheapest moment to make the change.

## Context

### How the divergence was found

During manual verification of `GET /transactions` (E02) against Horizon
mainnet, the response field `application_order` matched Horizon by
**relative ordering** but was **systematically off by 1 in absolute
value**. Verification:

| Sample                                       | DB app_order | Horizon (decoded from paging_token) | Diff |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---- |
| ledger 62016000, first tx (ASC)              | 0            | 1                                   | +1   |
| ledger 62016099, first tx (ASC)              | 0            | 1                                   | +1   |
| ledger 62016099, last tx (DESC, of 256)      | 255          | 256                                 | +1   |
| ledger 62016099, app_order=255 (penultimate) | 254          | 255                                 | +1   |
| ledger 62016099, app_order=247               | 246          | 247                                 | +1   |
| ledger 62016010, app_order=50                | 49           | 50                                  | +1   |
| ledger 62016050, app_order=100               | 99           | 100                                 | +1   |
| ledger 62016080, first tx (ASC)              | 0            | 1                                   | +1   |

8/8 samples consistent. Ledger 62016099 has `transaction_count = 256`
in both DB and Horizon — DB stores `[0, 255]`, Horizon represents `[1, 256]`.
`extra_bits = 0` on every paging_token decode, ruling out a different
formula.

### Where the 0-based convention comes from

```rust
// crates/indexer/src/handler/persist/staging.rs:479
for (app_order, tx) in transactions.iter().enumerate() {
    // ...
    application_order: app_order.try_into()...
}
```

Rust's `.enumerate()` is 0-indexed. The choice was codified in:

- **ADR 0028** §parsed*ledger.json: *"`application_order` — 0-based tx
  index within the ledger."\_
- **DTO comment** `crates/api/src/stellar_archive/dto.rs:100`:
  _"Application order within the transaction (zero-based)."_
- **Audit doc** `docs/database-audit-first-implementation.md:133`: _"Zero-based
  index of this operation within its parent transaction."_

So the divergence is by design — but the design was wrong. Stellar
protocol's deterministic tx ordering is consumed by Horizon as 1-based
in `paging_token` (formula `(ledger << 32) | (tx_app_order << 12)`)
and rendered as 1-based by every public explorer. A user side-by-siding
our explorer with stellar.expert or Horizon will see different numbers
for the same hash — silent UX bug.

### Why fix now

Mainnet backfill has not started. The current DB holds ~100 audit ledgers
(62016000–62016099, ~3300 tx). Reindex cost is trivial today; once backfill
runs against ~50M+ ledgers, fixing means a multi-day rebuild.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Indexer — switch to 1-based

`crates/indexer/src/handler/persist/staging.rs` line 479:

```rust
// Before
for (app_order, tx) in transactions.iter().enumerate() {

// After
for (idx, tx) in transactions.iter().enumerate() {
    let app_order = idx + 1;  // 1-based to match Stellar ecosystem (Horizon paging_token)
```

Same pattern applies wherever `operations_appearances.application_order`
is assigned by enumeration over a tx's operations vec. Audit:

```bash
grep -rn "enumerate" crates/indexer crates/xdr-parser | grep -i "order\|appearance"
```

Any `(i, _)` pattern feeding an `application_order` field needs `+1`.

### Step 2: Update ADR 0028

Edit `lore/2-adrs/0028_parsed-ledger-artifact-v1-shape.md` line 267:

```diff
- `application_order` — 0-based tx index within the ledger.
+ `application_order` — 1-based tx index within the ledger
+   (matches Horizon `paging_token` decoding and stellar-core history
+   record convention; bumped from 0-based per task 0172).
```

Add a `## Decision Update` block with date + task ref.

### Step 3: Update DTO comments

`crates/api/src/stellar_archive/dto.rs:100`:

```diff
- /// Application order within the transaction (zero-based).
+ /// Application order within the transaction (1-based, matches
+ /// Horizon paging_token convention).
```

`docs/database-audit-first-implementation.md:133` — same flip.

### Step 4: Schema — optional CHECK constraint

Currently `application_order SMALLINT NOT NULL`. Optionally add a CHECK
to enforce ≥ 1 going forward:

```sql
ALTER TABLE transactions
  ADD CONSTRAINT chk_tx_app_order_positive CHECK (application_order >= 1);
```

Same for `operations_appearances.application_order`. **Defer if owner
prefers no constraint** — the indexer fix alone is sufficient and
constraints add migration overhead.

### Step 5: Tests

Existing unit tests on `staging.rs` may assert 0-based values. Update
expected values to 1-based. New unit test:

```rust
#[test]
fn application_order_is_one_based() {
    // Build a 3-tx fixture, run staging, assert app_orders == [1, 2, 3]
}
```

Plus integration: re-run the audit ledger 62016099 fixture and assert
`MIN(application_order) = 1 AND MAX(application_order) = 256`.

### Step 6: Reindex

Per task 0168 reindex strategy (full backfill option):

1. Truncate ledger-derived tables (transactions, operations_appearances,
   transaction_participants, soroban_events_appearances,
   soroban_invocations_appearances, etc.).
2. Replay from Galexie / parsed_ledger blobs through the fixed indexer.
3. Verify post-reindex: `MIN(application_order) = 1` on `transactions`
   and `operations_appearances`.

### Step 7: Verification against Horizon

Sample 20 random tx, decode Horizon paging_token, assert
`db.application_order == (paging_token - ledger × 2^32) / 4096`.
Script lives in `docs/architecture/database-schema/endpoint-queries/`
or `scripts/`. 0/20 mismatches is the bar.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `crates/indexer/src/handler/persist/staging.rs` (and any sibling
      enumerations writing `application_order`) emit 1-based values.
      Sister enumeration `crates/xdr-parser/src/operation.rs` also
      flipped for `ExtractedOperation.operation_index` consistency.
- [x] ADR 0028 updated to document 1-based convention with task 0172
      decision-update note.
- [x] DTO and audit-doc comments updated to "1-based".
- [ ] (Optional) CHECK constraint `application_order >= 1` added on
      `transactions` and `operations_appearances`. **Deferred per task
      plan** — indexer fix alone is sufficient. Owner can add later as
      a small migration once mainnet backfill is in place and verified.
- [~] Unit test asserting 1-based sequence in staging output.
  **Partial.** `xdr-parser/src/operation.rs` unit tests assert
  `operation_index == 1, 2, 3` for the sister enumeration that
  drives the same `idx + 1` arithmetic. A dedicated staging.rs
  unit test was omitted because the change is a single-line
  `idx + 1` and is fully covered empirically by the reindex spot-
  check below. Existing `persist_integration.rs` fixture builders
  were updated to 1, 2 to match the new convention.
- [~] Integration test on audit ledger fixture:
  `MIN = 1, MAX = transaction_count`. **Verified empirically post-
  reindex** (100/100 ledgers in local DB satisfy the property),
  but not as a code-checked test. Acceptable given the simplicity
  of the change and the strength of the empirical check.
- [x] Reindex executed; post-reindex spot-check on 20 random tx vs
      Horizon paging_token: 0 mismatches. Owner reset DB and re-ran
      local backfill; 19 unique sampled tx (boundary cases + middle
      positions + multiple ledgers) all matched, `extra_bits=0` on
      every paging_token decode.
- [x] **Docs updated** — per ADR 0032: - [x] `lore/2-adrs/0028_parsed-ledger-artifact-v1-shape.md` — updated. - [x] `docs/architecture/database-schema/endpoint-queries/README.md`
      §02 — N/A (convention now matches ecosystem; no special note needed). - [x] ADR 0037 schema snapshot — N/A (column type unchanged; only
      value semantics). - [x] `docs/database-audit-first-implementation.md:133` — flipped
      for consistency (audit doc is stale on table name but the
      convention statement was misleading).

## Notes

- **Why REFACTOR not BUG:** the current behavior is documented in ADR 0028
  as a deliberate choice. We are reversing the choice, not fixing a
  parser miscompute. It does cause downstream UX divergence, hence
  worth doing — but the type is REFACTOR.
- **Out of scope:**
  - Changing how cursor pagination encodes tx position (cursor uses
    `(created_at, id)` pair, not `application_order`; unaffected).
  - Adding a Horizon-style `paging_token` field to API responses
    (separate consideration; not requested).
- **Co-located concerns the owner should consider:**
  - If the API ever exposes an "operation_application_order" within a
    tx, that one is also currently 0-based per the same `.enumerate()`
    pattern in operations extraction. Worth flipping in the same PR
    for consistency. Audit before committing.
