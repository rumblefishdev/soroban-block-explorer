# DOCS: Refresh wiki architecture snapshot (Rust backend) post ADR 0027-0037

## Summary

`lore/3-wiki/project/architecture-snapshot-rust-backend.md` is dated
2026-04-01. Since then ADRs 0026-0037 and ~22 tasks reshaped the system
fundamentally: surrogate BIGINT IDs everywhere, parsed-artifact strategy
abandoned in favour of read-time XDR fetch (ADR 0029), `*_appearances` index
pattern for events/invocations/operations, enum → smallint, tokens renamed
to assets, two new crates. Old snapshot is no longer a drift — it describes
a different system.

## Context

### Drift inventory (2026-04-01 → 2026-04-24)

**New ADRs (0026-0037):**

| ADR  | Shift                                                               |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0026 | accounts surrogate BIGINT id                                        |
| 0027 | post-surrogate schema + endpoint realizability (**baseline reset**) |
| 0028 | parsed-ledger-artifact v1 shape (superseded by 0029)                |
| 0029 | **abandoned parsed artifacts — read-time XDR fetch**                |
| 0030 | contracts surrogate BIGINT id                                       |
| 0031 | enum columns SMALLINT + Rust enum                                   |
| 0032 | evergreen `docs/architecture/**` maintenance policy                 |
| 0033 | `soroban_events_appearances` read-time detail                       |
| 0034 | `soroban_invocations_appearances` read-time detail                  |
| 0035 | drop `account_balance_history`                                      |
| 0036 | rename tokens → assets                                              |
| 0037 | current schema snapshot (**authoritative schema reference**)        |

**Implementation waves:**

- **Pre-0027 foundation:** 0100-0119 (CI, local dev, 0116 concurrency fix, 0117 backfill-bench)
- **Surrogate ID migration:** 0131, 0136, 0137, 0151, 0152
- **Big-bang schema reset:** 0140 (implement ADR 0027 from scratch)
- **Write/read path pivot:** 0145 → 0146 → 0147 → 0148 → 0149 → 0150
  (postgres backfill-runner → shared parsed-artifact core → live galexie
  Lambda → remove legacy write path → new write path → API XDR fetch read path)
- **Rename/cleanup:** 0154 (tokens→assets), 0155 (ADR audit), 0157-0159,
  0163-0164 (appearances refactors + column drops)

**Repository layout changes:**

- 9 crates now (was fewer): `api`, `indexer`, `xdr-parser`, `db`,
  `db-migrate`, `db-partition-mgmt`, `backfill-bench`, `backfill-runner`,
  `domain`
- Monorepo root has `crates/`, `web/`, `libs/`, `apps/`, `infra/aws-cdk` (TS CDK),
  `scripts/`, `tools/`, `docs/`
- Old snapshot described post-0094/0095 flatten as _target_; now it is
  current state

### Non-drift (still accurate in old snapshot)

- axum / utoipa / sqlx / lambda_http stack choice — unchanged
- cargo-lambda build toolchain — unchanged

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Overwrite in place

Overwrite `lore/3-wiki/project/architecture-snapshot-rust-backend.md`.
Git history preserves the 2026-04-01 version. Rationale: wiki CLAUDE.md
mandates _"Living documentation. Current state, not history. Focus on 'what
is' not 'what was'."_ Dated filenames imply historical archive, which is
what git already provides. Filename should describe what the file IS, not
when it was written.

### Step 2: Draft new snapshot

Cover:

1. **Backend stack table** — verify versions against workspace `Cargo.toml`
2. **Workspace layout** — all 9 crates + web + libs + infra/aws-cdk roles
3. **Schema model** — link ADR 0037 as source of truth; highlight:
   - surrogate BIGINT ids (accounts, contracts)
   - `*_appearances` index pattern (events/invocations/operations/transactions)
   - SMALLINT enums (ADR 0031)
   - assets nomenclature (ADR 0036)
4. **Ingestion pipeline** — live galexie Lambda → write path (0149) →
   partition automation (db-partition-mgmt); backfill via `backfill-runner`
5. **Read path** — API fetches XDR on demand per ADR 0029; no parsed
   artifacts stored
6. **Documentation model** — link to `docs/architecture/**` (evergreen per
   ADR 0032); snapshot = photograph, architecture docs = living

### Step 3: Do NOT duplicate `docs/architecture/**`

Snapshot must be a navigable overview + pointers, not a second copy of the
evergreen docs.

### Step 4: Flag frontend-stack drift (out of scope)

`lore/3-wiki/project/frontend-stack.md` also dated — references pending
tasks (0039, 0046, 0047, 0077) that have since moved. Do NOT touch in this
task; scope discipline per lore-framework (one task, one concern). Spawn
separate backlog task with `related_tasks: ["0165"]` if drift confirmed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Snapshot reflects ADRs 0026-0037 and repo state at time of writing
- [x] All 9 crates enumerated with one-line role each
- [x] ADR 0029 pivot (parsed artifacts → read-time XDR) called out explicitly
- [x] ADR 0037 cited as authoritative for schema; snapshot does not restate schema
- [x] `*_appearances` pattern explained once (not per table)
- [x] No duplication of `docs/architecture/**` content — pointers only
- [x] Commit overwrites old file in single commit so `git log --follow`
      surfaces 2026-04-01 version cleanly
- [x] **Docs updated** — N/A — wiki snapshot IS the doc artifact. Underlying
      `docs/architecture/**` is maintained evergreen per ADR 0032 by the tasks
      that drove each change.

## Implementation Notes

- File rewritten: `lore/3-wiki/project/architecture-snapshot-rust-backend.md`
  (233 lines; diff +218/−50 vs 2026-04-01 version).
- Structure: Stack / Workspace Layout / Crates / Data Model / Write Path /
  Read Path / API Bootstrap Status / Infrastructure / CI/CD / Where to Read Next.
- ADR 0037 cited as authoritative schema reference; no DDL restated.
- Write path diagram shows galexie → S3 `PutObject` → indexer Lambda
  (4 stages, one atomic tx) → Postgres via RDS Proxy; no intermediate
  "parsed-artifact Lambda" (task 0147 superseded by 0149).
- Prettier-clean (wiki uses project Prettier config).

## Design Decisions

### From Plan

1. **Overwrite in place, no dated filename.** Per wiki CLAUDE.md "living doc,
   current state" rule. Git history is the archive.
2. **Link, do not duplicate.** Snapshot points to `docs/architecture/**` as
   a narrative cross-cut; evergreen docs own the detail.
3. **ADR 0037 as schema reference.** No DDL in snapshot.

### Emerged

4. **Added §CI/CD and §Infrastructure stack tables.** Plan listed "ingestion
   pipeline" and "docs model" but not the CDK stack inventory or GH Actions.
   Both are part of the system shape and were missing from the old snapshot.
5. **Added §API Bootstrap Status with active-task pointers (0050/0123/0160).**
   Plan covered architecture shape but not the fact that the `api` crate is
   mid-bootstrap. Added because ADRs 0033/0034 explicitly defer handler wire-up
   pending this work — omitting it would mislead onboarders about the current
   state of read-path endpoints.
6. **Called out classification_cache semantics (SEP-0050 vs SEP-0041).** Not
   in plan, but discovered during gap audit that the cache's purpose (NFT vs
   fungible classification, task 0118 Phase 2 scaffold) is non-obvious from
   the filename alone.
7. **Dropped task 0147 from `related_tasks` frontmatter.** Initially included
   because it appeared in archive listings, but verification showed it was
   `superseded` — keeping it as a related task would mislead future readers.

## Issues Encountered

- **First draft was materially wrong on write path.** I initially described
  an intermediate "live parsed-artifact Lambda" (from task 0147 title). Reading
  the archived task 0147 revealed it was superseded by 0149 — the indexer
  Lambda itself subscribes to the galexie bucket and parses + persists in
  one invocation. No intermediate Lambda exists. Fix: re-read archived task
  READMEs rather than inferring from filenames.
- **"Stage 0024/0025/0026/0027" in `process.rs` are task IDs, not stage
  numbers.** Preserving them verbatim would confuse readers (easy to
  mistake "Stage 0027" for "ADR 0027"). Rewrote stage names by content
  (Ledger + Tx / Operations / Events+Invocations+Contracts / LedgerEntryChanges).
- **Local directory suffix `-2` leaked into the tree diagram.** Initial draft
  used `soroban-block-explorer-2/` as the workspace root label — that is
  the local clone name, not the repo name. Replaced with `.`.
- **Iterative gap audit.** Three rounds of "sprawdź czy nie ma luk" surfaced:
  Nx runner, BYTEA hashes (ADR 0024), RDS Proxy, GH Actions workflows,
  `classification_cache` semantics, and the task-ID-as-stage-label pitfall.
  Each pass was worthwhile; a single-pass draft would have shipped with
  material omissions.

## Future Work

- **0166** — `frontend-stack.md` refresh (spawned). Old file references
  pending tasks 0039 / 0046 / 0047 / 0077; need to verify current frontend
  state and update.
- **Cadence policy** (not spawned — not a concrete task). Consider setting
  re-snapshot trigger: quarterly, or after every N architectural-shape
  tasks. `/schedule` candidate.

## Notes

### Filename convention decision (resolved 2026-04-24)

**Overwrite in place.** Per wiki CLAUDE.md "living doc, current state" rule
and lore-framework guidance that wiki = "what IS" (not "what was").
Git history is the archive; dated filenames would duplicate that role.

### Possible follow-up tasks

- `frontend-stack.md` refresh (separate task — pending 0039/0046/0047/0077
  likely shipped)
- Cadence policy: re-snapshot after every N architectural tasks, or
  quarterly — `/schedule` candidate

### Why this is not just an evergreen-docs update

`docs/architecture/**` tracks the system as it is, file-by-file.
`lore/3-wiki/project/architecture-snapshot-*.md` is a **narrative overview**
useful for onboarding a stateless Claude session or a new human — cross-cuts
what the evergreen docs split across files.
