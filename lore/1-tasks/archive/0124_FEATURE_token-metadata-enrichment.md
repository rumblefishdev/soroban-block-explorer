    note: >
      Token metadata is now delivered by two complementary tasks. 0188
      (SEP-1 type-2 fetcher) covers the per-request runtime path —
      `description` and `home_page` on `GET /v1/assets/{id}`. 0191
      (type-1 SQS-driven worker) covers the persisted `assets.icon_url`
      column. The original "JSONB blob enrichment" approach is
      obsolete: typed columns + runtime fetch replaced the blob.

# Indexer: token metadata enrichment pipeline

## Summary

The `assets.metadata` JSONB column exists in the schema but `convert.rs:167` hardcodes it
to `None`. The `ExtractedAsset` struct has no `metadata` field. No task in backlog, active,
or archive addresses populating this column.

## Context

Token metadata (description, icon URL, home domain) comes from:

- SEP-1 stellar.toml files published at issuer's home_domain
- On-chain contract metadata (for Soroban tokens)
- External enrichment services

## Implementation

**Architecture decision (resolved by audit Section 9.3):** This MUST be a **scheduled
enrichment job**, NOT inline during indexer ingestion. Fetching external stellar.toml files
during ledger processing would add network latency and failure modes to the critical
ingestion path.

1. **Enrichment Worker Lambda** (new): dedicated Lambda triggered by EventBridge cron
   (daily). Scans assets with `metadata IS NULL`, fetches SEP-1 TOML from issuer's
   `home_domain` (if set in accounts table) to extract currency metadata.
2. For Soroban tokens: extract metadata from contract interface (name, symbol, decimals
   already available from WASM spec in `wasm_interface_metadata`).
3. Store in `assets.metadata` JSONB: `{"description": "...", "icon": "...", "domain": "..."}`.
4. **Infrastructure**: EventBridge rule (daily cron) + Lambda ARM64 256MB + IAM role with
   RDS access. Estimated cost: <$1/mo.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `assets.metadata` populated for classic assets with available SEP-1 TOML data
- [ ] `assets.metadata` populated for Soroban tokens with contract-level metadata
- [ ] Graceful handling of missing/unavailable metadata (remains NULL)
- [ ] API returns metadata in token detail response
- [ ] **Scheduled Enrichment Worker Lambda deployed** with EventBridge daily cron trigger
- [ ] Enrichment runs independently of indexer ingestion (no inline TOML fetches)
