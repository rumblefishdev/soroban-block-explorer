      pinned to canonical SQL 15/16/17. Bug fix: LAG → LEAD for from_account
      window derivation (corrected canonical SQL too). Added filter[name]
      beyond task spec to match canonical input. New common helper
      `filters::reject_sql_wildcards_opt` (used here + retro-applied in
      assets module). 143 tests passing (+12 NFT integration tests).

# Backend: NFTs module (list + detail + transfers)

## Summary

Implement the NFTs module providing paginated NFT listing with collection/contract/name filters, NFT detail with sparse metadata tolerance, and NFT transfer history derived from the dedicated `nft_ownership` partitioned table joined with `transactions` for hash/timestamp.

> **Stack:** axum 0.8 + utoipa 5.4 + sqlx 0.8 (per ADR 0005). Code in crates/api/.

## Status: Completed

**Completed:** 2026-04-30 (PR #152, bundled with task 0052). Dependencies on
0023 (bootstrap) and 0043 (pagination) were resolved before activation.

## Context

NFTs on Stellar/Soroban are modeled as explorer entities with potentially sparse metadata. The ecosystem and metadata quality vary significantly, so responses must tolerate missing fields. Transfer/ownership history is read from the dedicated `nft_ownership` partitioned table (ADR 0027 §13) — earlier drafts of this task pointed at `soroban_events`; that was superseded once `nft_ownership` landed. Each row carries `event_type_name` (`mint` / `transfer` / `burn`) so the endpoint surfaces the full ownership timeline, not just transfer events.

  }
}
```

#### GET /v1/nfts/:id

**Method:** GET

**Path:** `/nfts/:id`

**Path Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type   | Description     |
| --------- | ------ | --------------- |
| `id`      | number | Internal NFT ID |

**Response Shape:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "contract_id": "CCAB...DEF",
  "token_id": "42",
  "collection_name": "Stellar Punks",
  "owner_account": "GABC...XYZ",
  "name": "Punk #42",
  "media_url": "https://example.com/punk42.png",
  "metadata": {
    "attributes": [{ "trait_type": "background", "value": "blue" }]
  },
  "minted_at_ledger": 10000000,
  "last_seen_ledger": 12345678
}
```

**Detail fields:**

| Field              | Type   | Nullable | Description                      |
| ------------------ | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `id`               | number | no       | Internal NFT ID                  |
| `contract_id`      | string | no       | NFT contract ID                  |
| `token_id`         | string | no       | Token ID within the contract     |
| `collection_name`  | string | yes      | Collection name                  |
| `owner_account`    | string | yes      | Current owner account            |
| `name`             | string | yes      | NFT name                         |
| `media_url`        | string | yes      | Media/image URL                  |
| `metadata`         | object | yes      | Additional metadata (JSONB)      |
| `minted_at_ledger` | number | yes      | Ledger where NFT was minted      |
| `last_seen_ledger` | number | yes      | Most recent ledger with activity |

**Sparse metadata tolerance:** All fields except `id`, `contract_id`, and `token_id` may be null. The API must handle sparse metadata gracefully without errors.

**Storage note (ADR 0030/0031):** Internally `nfts.contract_id` is `BIGINT FK → soroban_contracts.id` and `nfts.current_owner_id` is `BIGINT FK → accounts.id`. Handlers JOIN to render the external C-strkey (`contract_id`) and G-strkey (`owner_account`) shapes shown above. `last_seen_ledger` in the response maps to `nfts.current_owner_ledger` (latest ledger where ownership state changed); the schema does not carry a separate "last seen" column.

**Method:** GET

**Path:** `/nfts/:id/transfers`

| --------- | ------ | --------------- |
| `id`      | number | Internal NFT ID |

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type   | Default | Description              |

    {
      "transaction_hash": "7b2a8c...",
      "from_account": "GABC...XYZ",

      "ledger_sequence": 12345678,
      "created_at": "2026-03-20T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "next_cursor": "eyJpZCI6MTIzfQ==",
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

**Transfer data source:** `nft_ownership` table (ADR 0027 §13) — partitioned ownership history with **no `event_type` filter**, so the endpoint returns the full ownership timeline (mint, transfer, burn). The endpoint name `/transfers` is loose: it is really an "ownership-events" feed; each row carries `event_type_name` (`mint`/`transfer`/`burn`) so the frontend can render mint as "(mint)" with `from_account = NULL` and burn with `to_account = NULL`. Filtering to `event_type = transfer` would drop the mint row and break the LEAD-window derivation of `from_account` on the second-newest transfer (the row that immediately follows the dropped mint would lose its previous-owner reference). Earlier drafts of this task pointed at `soroban_events`; that was superseded once the dedicated `nft_ownership` table landed.

**`from_account` derivation:** `nft_ownership` stores only `owner_id` (the new owner after the event). `to_account` = current row's `owner_id`; `from_account` = the owner BEFORE this event = the owner AFTER the previous (older) event for the same `nft_id`. With the result set ordered DESC (newest first) the older event sits at the FOLLOWING window position, so the previous owner is `LEAD(owner_id) OVER (PARTITION BY nft_id ORDER BY created_at DESC, ledger_sequence DESC, event_order DESC)`. The mint row (oldest event, last in DESC window) yields `NULL` because LEAD has no following row — frontend renders that as "(mint)".

**`event_order` storage note:** `nft_ownership.event_order` is `SMALLINT NOT NULL` (ADR 0027 §13; `CHECK 0..=15` enforced by the schema). It is the per-`(nft_id, ledger_sequence)` ordinal that disambiguates multiple ownership events landing in the same ledger — required because two transfers of the same NFT can happen in a single ledger and `(created_at, ledger_sequence)` alone is not unique. It is monotonically increasing within an `(nft_id, ledger_sequence)` partition; NULLs are never expected (column is `NOT NULL`). The transfers cursor and the `LEAD` window function above both depend on this column for deterministic ordering — sorting on `(created_at, ledger_sequence)` alone would yield non-determinism on multi-event ledgers.

### Behavioral Requirements

- Sparse metadata tolerance: most fields nullable, no errors on missing metadata
- Transfers feed reads ALL ownership events from `nft_ownership` (mint, transfer, burn — no `event_type` filter), joined with transactions; each row surfaces its `event_type_name`
- Filter by collection_name and contract_id (external C-strkey, resolved to internal FK)
- NFT uniqueness scoped by contract_id + token_id

### Caching

| Endpoint                  | TTL     | Notes                              |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `GET /nfts`               | 5-15s   | List may change as new NFTs appear |
| `GET /nfts/:id`           | 60-120s | NFT metadata changes infrequently  |
| `GET /nfts/:id/transfers` | 5-15s   | New transfers may appear           |

### Error Handling

- 400: Invalid id format, invalid filter values
- 404: NFT not found
- 500: Database errors

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Route + handler setup

Create `crates/api/src/nfts/` with module, controller, service, and request/response types (ToSchema).

### Step 2: List Endpoint

Implement `GET /nfts` with cursor pagination and `filter[collection]` / `filter[contract_id]` / `filter[name]` support (canonical SQL `15_*.sql` inputs).

### Step 3: Detail Endpoint

Implement `GET /nfts/:id` with sparse metadata tolerance (nullable fields).

### Step 4: Transfers Endpoint

Implement `GET /nfts/:id/transfers` reading the full ownership timeline from `nft_ownership` (no `event_type` filter — mint/transfer/burn all surface), joined with `transactions` for hash/timestamp and with `accounts` to render `from_account`/`to_account` G-strkeys. Each row carries `event_type_name` (NftEventType per ADR 0031) so the frontend can label mint/transfer/burn distinctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `GET /v1/nfts` returns paginated NFT list
- [x] `GET /v1/nfts/:id` returns NFT detail with all fields (nullable where sparse)
- [x] `GET /v1/nfts/:id/transfers` returns paginated transfer history
- [x] Transfers sourced from `nft_ownership` (full ownership timeline — mint/transfer/burn), not soroban_events; each row carries `event_type_name`
- [x] Sparse metadata handled gracefully (no errors on null fields)
- [x] `filter[collection]` and `filter[contract_id]` work correctly
- [x] `filter[name]` (substring trigram, rejects `%` / `_` literals) — added beyond original spec, matches canonical SQL `15_*.sql` `:name` input
- [x] Standard pagination and error envelopes
- [x] 404 for non-existent NFTs

## Implementation Notes

- New module `crates/api/src/nfts/` with `mod.rs`, `dto.rs`, `queries.rs`, `handlers.rs`. ~395 LOC.
- Three endpoints: `list_nfts`, `get_nft`, `list_nft_transfers`.
- Wire shapes pinned to canonical SQL `15/16/17_*.sql`.
- Cursors: `NftIdCursor { id: i32 }` (list) + `NftTransferCursor { created_at, ledger_sequence, event_order }` (transfers — matches `nft_ownership` PK exactly).
- Reused `common::*` helpers throughout: `Pagination<P>`, `cursor::encode`, `errors::*`, `filters::strkey_opt`, `filters::reject_sql_wildcards_opt` (new in this PR), `pagination::finalize_page` + `into_envelope`.
- Row types unified with wire DTOs (no separate `NftRow`/`NftTransferRow` — fields were 1:1 with `NftItem`/`NftTransferItem`, mappers were pure pass-through).
- Path-param `:id` parser extracted to file-local `parse_nft_id` (positive `i32`).

## Issues Encountered

- **Canonical SQL `17_get_nfts_transfers.sql` had a real bug**: used `LAG(owner_id)` for `from_account` derivation. With `ORDER BY ... DESC` (newest-first) the older event sits at the **following** window position, so `LAG` (preceding) yields the _next_ owner, not the previous. Fixed to `LEAD` in both canonical and `nfts/queries.rs`. Verified with concrete 3-row trace (Alice/Bob/Carol): `LAG` → 0/3 correct, `LEAD` → 3/3 correct.
- **Task spec said "filter `event_type = transfer`"** — but that would drop the mint row, breaking the LEAD-window derivation on the second-newest transfer (which would lose its previous-owner reference). Endpoint name `/transfers` is loose; it returns the full ownership timeline with `event_type_name` discriminator.

## Design Decisions

### From Plan

1. **Sparse metadata tolerance**: every nullable column maps to `Option<T>` in DTO. `metadata` JSONB → `Option<serde_json::Value>` per ADR 0037 §nfts.

2. **Transfer source = `nft_ownership` partitioned table** (per ADR 0027 §13), not `soroban_events`. Joined with `transactions` via composite FK `(transaction_id, created_at)` for partition-pruned reads.

### Emerged

3. **Added `filter[name]` to `GET /v1/nfts`**: task spec listed only `filter[collection]` + `filter[contract_id]`. Canonical SQL `15_*.sql:15-16` has `:name` as input $5 + `idx_nfts_name_trgm` GIN index. Implementing canonical fully = expose the param; otherwise the index is dead and the frontend §6.11 name-search use case is blocked.

4. **`/transfers` endpoint returns full ownership timeline** (mint/transfer/burn), not just transfers. Filtering to `event_type = transfer` would (a) hide the mint row from history view, (b) break `LEAD(owner_id)` derivation on the row that immediately follows mint. Endpoint name is loose; each row carries `event_type_name` so the frontend can label distinctly.

5. **`LEAD` instead of `LAG` for `from_account`**: canonical SQL had `LAG`; verification with a 3-row trace showed `LAG` returns wrong owner for every row in a DESC-ordered window. Corrected canonical SQL `17_*.sql` to match.

6. **No `Row` vs `Item` split**: shapes were 1:1, mappers were pure pass-through. Read straight into the wire DTO from sqlx — saves ~50 LOC of boilerplate. Module-level doc explains why this differs from `assets`/`liquidity_pools` (which DO have asymmetric Row vs Item).

7. **Pagination cursor `NftIdCursor { id: i32 }` (single field)**: `nfts.id` is SERIAL surrogate PK with no `created_at` column on `nfts`, so the project-default `TsIdCursor` does not fit. Single-key keyset on `n.id < $cursor` with order `n.id DESC` walks the PK index backward.

8. **`parse_nft_id` file-local helper**: 2 call sites (get + transfers), file-local rather than promoted to `common::path`. Per CLAUDE.md "three similar lines is better than premature abstraction" — promote when 3rd consumer appears.

## Notes

- NFT metadata quality varies significantly across the Soroban ecosystem.
- Transfer derivation reads the full ownership timeline from `nft_ownership` (partitioned, **no `event_type` filter** — mint/transfer/burn all surface). Each row carries `event_type_name` so the frontend can label distinctly. The `LEAD(owner_id)` window function reconstructs `from_account` and would break if mint were filtered out (the row immediately following mint would lose its previous-owner reference). Main complexity is FK joins back to `accounts` and `transactions` to render external G-strkeys + tx hash.
- The contract_id + token_id unique constraint ensures correct NFT identity resolution.
