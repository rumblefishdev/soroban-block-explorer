      `holder_count` aggregation is meaningful only after the full
      Soroban-era corpus lands in RDS — running it on a sparse
      pre-backfill dataset would ship misleading counts. Unblocks
      once `backfill-runner` (task 0145) finishes the historical
      sweep.

      Task 0194 (FEATURE — completed 2026-05-11, karolkow) shipped
      `recompute_asset_aggregates` in
      `crates/indexer/src/handler/persist/write.rs`, populating
      `assets.holder_count` (and `total_supply`) on every ledger that
      touches the asset, via `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE balance > 0)`
      over `account_balances_current` — active-holder semantics
      matching StellarExpert convention. Per-ledger overhead +4%
      mean, +1ms p99. Task 0196 (enrichment-backfill crate) covers
      the dormant-assets bulk recount that the per-ledger path skips,
      so the combination provides both ongoing tracking AND historical
      catch-up. Scope coverage exceeds the original 0135 spec
      (incremental counter on trustline events was Option A; 0194 chose
      per-ledger SQL recompute instead — simpler, parallel-backfill-safe
      by construction). Soroban-token holder_count (0135 §Out of Scope)
      remains a future follow-up if user-visible drift materialises.

# Indexer: ongoing token holder_count tracking

## Summary

The technical design specifies `holder_count` in both the asset list table and asset detail
page. The column exists in the schema (`assets.holder_count INTEGER`) but is never populated
— it is always NULL. The indexer's `detect_assets()` does not compute holder counts, and
there is no ongoing mechanism to update them as trustline/balance changes occur.

## Context

Holder count cannot be extracted from a single `LedgerCloseMeta` XDR — it requires knowing
the total number of accounts holding a non-zero balance of a given token. This is either:

1. A full DB aggregation (count distinct accounts with trustline to this asset)
2. An incremental counter updated on every trustline create/remove event

Option 2 is more efficient at scale but requires task 0119 (trustline balance extraction)
to be implemented first, since trustline entries are the source of holder state changes.

## Implementation

**Option A — Incremental counter (recommended):**

1. During trustline extraction (task 0119), detect when a trustline is created (new holder)
   or removed (lost holder) for a token.
2. Increment/decrement `assets.holder_count` atomically:
   `UPDATE assets SET holder_count = COALESCE(holder_count, 0) + 1 WHERE ...`
3. After historical backfill, run a one-time correction query to set accurate counts.

**Option B — Periodic aggregation:**

1. Scheduled job (EventBridge + Lambda) that runs:
   `UPDATE assets SET holder_count = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT account_id) FROM ... WHERE ...)`
2. Simpler but expensive at scale and always slightly stale.

**Option C — Materialized view:**

1. Create a materialized view counting holders per token.
2. Refresh on schedule or trigger.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `assets.holder_count` populated for classic assets (trustline-based)
- [ ] `assets.holder_count` updated incrementally on trustline create/remove
- [ ] Holder count visible in `GET /assets` list and `GET /assets/:id` detail
- [ ] One-time backfill correction after historical ingestion
- [ ] Test: token with 3 holders shows holder_count = 3
- [ ] **Parallel backfill safety**: inline increment/decrement MUST be disabled during
      parallel backfill (concurrent +1/-1 is not safe). Implementation must include a
      feature flag or config toggle to disable inline updates. Post-backfill one-time
      recount (AC #4) is the sole source of truth after historical ingestion.
      (See audit Section 10.3 for details.)

## Out of Scope

**Soroban token holders** are NOT covered by this task. Soroban tokens track balances via
`ContractData` storage entries, not Stellar trustlines. Per-contract storage layout parsing
depends on task 0120 (soroban-native token detection). A follow-up task should extend
holder_count to Soroban tokens once 0120 is implemented.
