# Rewrite ALL SQL migrations to derive from domain types

## Summary

Rewrite all migrations (0001-0006) with domain types (`crates/domain/`) as source of truth. The DB is empty — no data risk. This establishes the correct workflow going forward: types define the contract, migrations implement it.

Scope expanded from original plan: migration 0001 included for consistent style, and `operation_tree` field added to `Transaction` domain struct.

## Status: Active

**Current state:** Implementation complete, pending commit.

## Context

All migrations were written before Rust domain types existed (the TS→Rust migration gap). Task 0101 created domain types by reverse-engineering the existing migrations. Now we invert the relationship: domain types are the spec, migrations are derived.

Known issues with current migrations:

- Task 0020 DDL spec diverges from actual migration 0006 (nfts PK structure, column sizes, nullability, fee_bps NOT NULL)
- No single source of truth — changes to schema require updating both domain types and migrations independently
- Migration 0001 was ORM-generated (quoted identifiers, verbose FK syntax) while 0002-0006 were hand-written — inconsistent style
- `transactions.operation_tree` column existed in DB but was missing from `Transaction` domain struct
- Stale `DEFAULT` values on nullable columns (`parse_error`, `is_sac`, `holder_count`) conflicted with `Option<_>` domain types

### Target workflow (going forward)

1. Define/update struct in `crates/domain/`
2. Write migration SQL that matches the struct exactly
3. Both in the same PR

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Add operation_tree to Transaction struct

Add `pub operation_tree: Option<serde_json::Value>` to `Transaction` in `crates/domain/src/transaction.rs`. This was a DB column missing from the domain type — pre-computed Soroban invocation call tree populated by the ingestion pipeline.

### Step 2: Delete ALL migrations 0001-0006

Move to `.trash/` per project policy.

### Step 3: Rewrite migration for ledgers + transactions

Derive DDL from `domain::ledger::Ledger` and `domain::transaction::Transaction`. Rewrite from ORM-generated style to clean hand-written SQL. Drop stale `DEFAULT false` from `parse_error`. Include `operation_tree` JSONB column.

### Step 4: Rewrite migration for operations

Derive DDL from `domain::operation::Operation`. Verify every field, type, nullability matches.

### Step 5: Rewrite migration for soroban_contracts

Derive from `domain::soroban::SorobanContract`. Drop `DEFAULT FALSE` from `is_sac`. Include `search_vector` TSVECTOR generated column (DB-only, excluded from domain struct by design).

### Step 6: Rewrite migration for soroban_invocations + soroban_events

Derive from `domain::soroban::SorobanInvocation` and `domain::soroban::SorobanEvent`. Include partitioning and initial partitions.

### Step 7: Rewrite migration for accounts + tokens

Derive from `domain::account::Account` and `domain::token::Token`. Drop `DEFAULT 0` from `holder_count`.

### Step 8: Rewrite migration for nfts + pools + snapshots

Derive from `domain::nft::Nft`, `domain::pool::LiquidityPool`, `domain::pool::LiquidityPoolSnapshot`. Include partitioning for snapshots.

### Step 9: Verify migrations apply cleanly

`sqlx migrate run` against a fresh PostgreSQL instance.

### Step 10: Close/update tasks 0018, 0019, 0020

Update status of DDL tasks to reflect the rewrite.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ALL migrations 0001-0006 rewritten — every column matches domain struct field
- [x] Domain types are the documented source of truth for schema (inline comments)
- [x] `sqlx migrate run` applies cleanly to fresh PostgreSQL (verified on staging)
- [x] Indexes, FKs, constraints, partitioning preserved
- [x] DB-only columns (search_vector) documented as exceptions
- [x] `operation_tree` added to Transaction domain struct
- [x] Stale DEFAULTs removed (parse_error, holder_count); is_sac DEFAULT kept for upsert safety
- [x] Consistent SQL style across all migrations
- [x] Tasks 0018, 0019 already archived; 0020 completed and archived

## Notes

- DB is empty — this is a pure rewrite with zero data risk
- This task also resolves the task 0020 divergence issue flagged in 0101
- `accounts.balances` DEFAULT '[]' kept — non-optional field, default is INSERT convenience
- FK transactions→ledgers preserved as original `ON DELETE NO ACTION` (no behavior change)

## Deploy: reset DB before running new migrations

Migration file checksums changed — sqlx will reject them on any DB that ran the old versions.
Full schema wipe required (migrations use `CREATE TABLE` without `IF NOT EXISTS`).

Connect via SSM tunnel + psql:

```sql
DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA public;
```

Then redeploy the migration Lambda (CDK stack `Explorer-{env}-Migration`).
