      Found while asking why the SAC → asset link on a contract detail page
      goes unnoticed. It is not under-emphasised: `IdentifierDisplay` renders a
      link in `text.primary` with `textDecoration: none`, so the only signal is
      the mouse cursor. Scope is the shared component and the rule, not that one
      chip.

      competing link definitions are both located in the code, and the open

# BUG: a link in content is indistinguishable from plain text

## Summary

[`IdentifierDisplay`](../../../libs/ui/src/identifiers/IdentifierDisplay.tsx)
is the shared renderer for every identifier in the explorer — account, contract,
asset, hash, pool, token. A linked one is drawn in exactly the same colour and
weight as an unlinked one:

```ts
color: theme.palette.text.primary,   // identical to surrounding body text
textDecoration: 'none',
'&:hover': { color: theme.palette.surface.primaryMainAlt },  // colour only
cursor: linked ? 'pointer' : 'inherit',
```

The **only** thing separating a link from static text is `cursor: pointer`. On a
mouse you must hover to find out; on touch there is no signal at all.

## Why this is a defect and not a preference

`linked={false}` is real and used — `ContractSummary` alone passes it on lines
51 and 137, next to identifiers that ARE linked. So one screen shows clickable
and non-clickable identifiers rendered identically, and nothing but trial and
error tells them apart.

WCAG 1.4.1 (Use of Color) requires that information not be carried by a visual
difference alone; here there is not even a colour difference to fall back on.

Observed, not theorised: the SAC → asset link shipped by 0472 was not noticed by
someone who knows this product and was looking at that page.

## The second half — there are two definitions of "link"

| where                                                                                                | style                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `IdentifierDisplay` (42 usages, 32 files)                                                            | no underline, hover = colour |
| MUI `Link underline="hover"` — `NftDetailPage`, `LedgerDetailPage`, `transactions/cells`, and 3 more | underline on hover           |
| `SecondaryNav`, `Footer`, `NavButton`, `DomainChip`                                                  | `textDecoration: 'none'`     |

The same element behaves differently depending on which page you are on. 0062
(which built the component) set out "visually identical everywhere: same
truncation rules, font, hover behavior, link styling" — that held for
truncation and font, not for the link.

## Implementation

### 1. The rule, written down once

**Links in content are underlined. Navigation and chrome are not.** The nav,
footer and nav buttons keep `textDecoration: 'none'` — position and container
already say they are interactive. This rule is the deliverable; the CSS is the
easy part.

### 2. Affordance in `IdentifierDisplay`, gated on `linked`

```ts
...(linked && {
  textDecoration: 'underline',
  textDecorationColor: alpha(theme.palette.text.primary, 0.35),
  textUnderlineOffset: '3px',
}),
'&:hover': linked ? {
  color: theme.palette.surface.primaryMainAlt,
  textDecorationColor: 'currentColor',
} : undefined,
```

Three details that are load-bearing:

- **`textDecorationColor` at ~35% alpha, not a full-strength rule.** Identifiers
  live in dense tables — every hash in the transactions list is a link — and a
  solid underline on each row reads as noise rather than as affordance.
- **`textUnderlineOffset`.** Identifiers are monospace and full of descenders
  (`g`, `y`, `p` in every hash); the default underline cuts through them.
- **Gated on `linked`.** This is the whole point: the underline must be exactly
  what distinguishes `linked={true}` from `linked={false}`, which today is
  invisible.

### 3. Converge the MUI `Link` sites

Six `underline="hover"` call sites become the same rule — either by routing them
through `IdentifierDisplay` where they render an identifier, or by matching the
style where they do not.

### 4. Chips stay as they are

[`ContractFaceChip`](../../../web/src/pages/contracts/ContractFaceChip.tsx)
wraps a `<Chip>` in a `RouterLink` with an explicit `textDecoration: 'none'`.
A chip already carries affordance in its background and shape, and underlining
text inside one reads as a rendering bug. If chip links need strengthening it is
a hover treatment on the chip surface, not on its label — separate question,
not this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A linked identifier is distinguishable from an unlinked one **without
      hovering** — verified on a page that shows both (contract detail carries
      `linked={false}` and linked identifiers side by side)
- [ ] The transactions list, where every row carries a linked hash, still reads
      as a table rather than a wall of underlines — screenshot before/after
- [ ] Light and dark both checked; the alpha holds up on both grounds
- [ ] The six MUI `Link underline="hover"` sites and `IdentifierDisplay` agree
- [ ] Nav, footer and chips unchanged
- [ ] **Docs updated** — N/A: component styling, not the shape of the system
      (no schema, endpoint, pipeline or data-contract change).
- [ ] **API types regenerated** — N/A, frontend only.

## Not in scope

**Giving links their own colour** (the Etherscan-blue convention). It would
collide with [[0467]], which is mid-flight: light mode just moved to graphite
and the brand yellow is deliberately reserved. Introducing a new semantic colour
now fights that work. Underline first; revisit colour once 0467 closes, if it is
still wanted.

Making search hits distinguishable from one another is [[0484]] — a different
problem (telling two `USDC` rows apart), not affordance.
