# LP completeness

## Summary

Make liquidity-pool activity complete: match the native XLM leg (currently
unmatchable → 21.7% of pools invisible), union Soroban-AMM pools into
`/liquidity-pools`, and recompute stale `share_percentage`.

## Context

Spawned from 0359. Mostly read/query-side: the native leg fails to match because
of the two-conventions native representation (see memory: native two
conventions); Soroban AMMs live outside the classic pool table.

## Implementation

- **F-B / K2-2** — match the native XLM leg in LP snapshots (16 552 pools /
  21.7% currently invisible).
- **K3-5** — surface Soroban-AMM pools. The union into `/liquidity-pools` is the
  final step; the actual work is extracting pool state we do not index at all
  today (no reserves, no swap volume, no pool row — only the LP token contract).
  One adapter per protocol:
  - **Soroswap first** — its LP tokens already carry on-chain `METADATA` we
    read (248 `…Soroswap…` names in `soroban_contract_metadata`), so pool
    discovery is a lookup.
  - **Aquarius second** — only 19 metadata hits, so its pool contracts must be
    discovered via factory/registry and decoded from swap events. The harder
    half, despite being the more-requested one in issue 405.
  - then union with the classic pools + a Classic/Soroban filter on the list
    (cheap once both live in one list).
  - `ContractType` has no `Dex` variant — 131 740 contracts sit in `Other`.
    Splitting it is anticipated in `crates/domain/src/enums/contract_type.rs`.
- **K4-6** — recompute stale LP `share_percentage` (unconfirmed; verify first).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] native XLM leg matches → pools visible — F-B / K2-2 (fixed by 0440/0470 along the way; verified on prod 2026-08-29, see below)
- [ ] Soroswap pools indexed (reserves + volume) and unioned — K3-5 (next protocol, after the Aquarius deploy)
- [x] Aquarius pools indexed and unioned — K3-5 (code complete + verified; ships with the final-phase deploy/backfills)
- [x] Classic / Soroban filter on the pool list — K3-5 (filter[pool_kind] + FE dropdown)
- [x] share_percentage correct (or confirmed already correct) — K4-6 (confirmed correct; the real gap was holder coverage — snapshot-seed-lp built, [K] run pending)

## Aquarius first — on-chain research, 2026-08-21

Decision: Aquarius is the first Soroban AMM adapter. Everything below was
measured against production ClickHouse and cross-checked against mainnet via
`stellar contract invoke --send=no` (read-only simulation, RPC
`mainnet.sorobanrpc.com`). Nothing here is inferred from our own code.

### What the store already holds

`soroban_events.topics_xdr` / `data_xdr` are decoded scval JSON, so the whole
protocol is already queryable without touching XDR again:

| Event                                      | Emitter | Shape                                                                                                                                                                | Rows            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `add_pool`                                 | router  | topics `[sym, vec<token addresses>]`, data `[pool address, sym pool_type, bytes pool_hash, vec params]`                                                              | 410             |
| `update_reserves`                          | pool    | topics `[sym]`, data `vec<i128>` — one entry per token, **same order as the pool's `get_tokens()`**                                                                  | 3 302 989       |
| `trade`                                    | pool    | topics `[sym, token_in, token_out, caller]`, data `[amount_in, amount_out, fee]`                                                                                     | 4 158 845       |
| `deposit_liquidity` / `withdraw_liquidity` | pool    | topics `[sym, …tokens]`, data `[shares, …amounts]` _(corrected 2026-08-26 — recorded backwards here originally; shares is element 0, verified on ledger 61 777 648)_ | 75 276 / 27 145 |

Event arity tracks token count: 2-token pools give 3 topics / 3 data, the
3-token stable pools give 4 / 4. No other variants exist across all history.

### Three findings that change the plan

**1. There are TWO routers, not one — and pools exist outside both.**
_(Counts corrected 2026-08-26 — there are ten routers and 496 pools; see
the verification pass at the end of this file.)_

`CBQDHNBF…6QUK` (the address Aquarius documents) holds 304 token sets / **337
pools**. A second contract, `CA7RQDMM…UOJQ`, reports `contract_name() =
"AMMRouter"`, `version() = 200` — same as the first — and holds 57 token sets /
**73 pools**, disjoint from the first. Total **410 registered pools**:
`constant` 319, `stable` 57, `concentrated` 34.

Each router's `add_pool` events reproduce its live registry **exactly** (337 and
73, verified by enumerating `get_pools_for_tokens_range` on chain and diffing
the address sets — zero difference either way). But of the 177 pools active in
the newest partition, **10 are absent from the first router's registry**; all 10
sit in the second. Building discovery on one documented router address silently
drops ~6 % of live pools.

→ Discovery must be shape-driven, not address-driven: any contract emitting
`add_pool` IS a router; any contract emitting `update_reserves` + `trade` IS a
pool, registered or not. No hard-coded addresses.

**2. Aquarius DOES have share tokens — participants come free after all.**

An earlier read of this said otherwise; it was wrong, and it was wrong because
it checked the POOL contract against `assets` instead of the pool's share
token. `share_id()` on a `constant` pool returns a separate token contract,
which is already indexed:

- pool `CD3XIX65…UKWL` → share token `CAM3JVJL…3ZYY`
- our `balances`, deduped by `argMax(amount, last_updated_ledger)`: **5 holders,
  8 810 229 081 shares**
- chain `get_total_shares()`: **8 810 229 081** — exact match

The dedup is not optional: the raw `sum(amount)` on the same asset returns
19 412 769 722 (10 rows for 5 holders) — unmerged RMT duplicates.

`concentrated` pools are the exception: `share_id()` returns the pool itself,
the pool is not in `assets`, and positions are tick-ranged (`position_update`,
`pool_state`). Those need their own treatment or an explicit "not indexed".

**3. Concentrated pools are not a rounding error — they are a third of the flow.**

Newest partition, by pool type: `constant` 25 079 trades over 122 pools,
`concentrated` 21 356 over 21, `stable` 8 010 over 24. The single busiest
Aquarius pool on the network is concentrated (XLM/AQUA, fee 10, tick spacing
20). Shipping "constant only" would omit ~39 % of recent trades **and** the top
pool — that is not a defensible first cut.

### Reserves are exact — verified against chain, three pool types

Latest `update_reserves` from our events vs live `get_reserves()`:

| Pool            | Type         | Ours                                       | Chain     |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| `CBBMQBNH…BUCV` | concentrated | `40196052765563, 5748484968000`            | identical |
| `CBMWU357…2LSH` | constant     | `1044176401956, 353830778`                 | identical |
| `CCYMZTOJ…JX25` | stable       | `1282501540990846914271528, 7176974914804` | identical |

`get_tokens()` order matched the `add_pool` token vector on every pool checked,
so the reserve vector needs no reordering.

Trade arithmetic reconciles too: between two consecutive snapshots on
`CBMWU357…2LSH`, `reserve_out` moved by exactly `-amount_out` and `reserve_in`
by `amount_in - fee` (exact on one sample, 1 unit off on another — rounding, to
be pinned as a tolerance, not assumed away).

### Traps to design against

- **`trade` topic 4 is the CALLER, not the end user.** On router-mediated swaps
  it is the router address. Sampled counts (244 654 trades over 30 days through
  113 distinct addresses) are a symptom of this, not of 113 real traders. Do not
  render it as "trader".
- **Reserves are not Decimal128(7).** A stable-pool token carries 18 decimals
  (`CBZ4DCE7…N2PJ`, `decimals() = 18`, reserve 1.28e24 raw). Store raw `Int128`
  plus decimals; the classic `liquidity_pool_snapshots` scale would corrupt it.
  That same token has **no row** in `soroban_contract_metadata`, so decimals
  cannot always be resolved from our store today.
- **Leg identity needs two lookups.** `asset_sac` by `sac_contract_id` resolves
  native and classic-credit legs (verified: XLM SAC → native, `CCW67TSZ…MI75` →
  USDC); soroban-native legs resolve directly on `assets.contract_id`.
- **`soroban_contracts.wasm_hash` is stale for upgraded contracts** (task 0320),
  so it is NOT a usable discovery key — the four pools sampled showed three
  different hashes.
- **22 % of trade history predates its pool's reserve stream.** 921 119 of
  4 158 845 trades, across 79 pools, occur before that pool's first
  `update_reserves`. Reconstruction backwards from the first known snapshot is
  arithmetically possible (deltas above) but must be proven per pool, not
  assumed.

## Atomic steps

Each step is independently landable and carries its own check.

**A. Registry**

> Superseded in part by the schema review of 2026-08-27 at the end of this
> file: four tables, not two; every fact table keys on
> `(pool_id, ledger_sequence, transaction_id, event_index)`; the registry is an
> `AggregatingMergeTree`, not a plain RMT.

1. `CREATE TABLE soroban_pools` — pool contract id, protocol, pool type,
   registering router id (0 = unregistered), token ids array, fee params,
   share token id, first-seen ledger, version column. Raw `Int128` policy
   applies to nothing here; this table is identity only. _(Karol runs the DDL.)_
2. Parser arm: any `add_pool` event → pool row, router taken from the emitter.
   No address allowlist.
3. Parser arm: `update_reserves` / `trade` from a contract with no pool row →
   write a pool row with `router = 0`, tokens from the trade topics. Orphans are
   never silently dropped.
4. Backfill: `INSERT … SELECT` over `soroban_events` for `add_pool`. 410 rows.
5. **Check:** enumerate every discovered router on chain via
   `get_pools_for_tokens_range` and diff against the table. Zero pools live but
   missing. (Script exists in scratch form from this research.)

**B. Reserves**

6. `CREATE TABLE pool_state_changes` — pool id, ledger, `Array(Int128)`
   reserves, source event index. _(Karol runs the DDL.)_
7. Parser arm: `update_reserves` → snapshot row.
8. Backfill: `INSERT … SELECT`, ~3.3 M rows.
9. **Check:** for a sample across all three pool types, latest stored reserves
   equal live `get_reserves()`. Three pools already pass; widen the sample.

**C. Volume**

10. Parser arm: `trade` → per-trade row (pool, ledger, token_in/out ids,
    amount_in, amount_out, fee).
11. Backfill, ~4.16 M rows.
12. **Check:** between consecutive snapshots, `Δreserve_in == amount_in - fee`
    and `Δreserve_out == -amount_out`, within the documented rounding tolerance.

**D. Identity and units**

13. Leg resolver: contract address → asset identity via `asset_sac`
    (`sac_contract_id`) with fallback to `assets.contract_id`. Unit tests for
    native, classic-credit, soroban-native.
14. Decimals resolver + the missing-metadata case. A leg whose decimals are
    unknown renders raw with an explicit marker — never a plausible wrong number.

**E. Participants**

15. Derive share token per pool from events: the token contract emitting `mint`
    in the same transaction as the pool's `deposit_liquidity`.
    **Check:** matches `share_id()` on a sample.
16. Participants read = `balances` on that asset, deduped by
    `argMax(amount, last_updated_ledger)`.
    **Check:** summed shares equal chain `get_total_shares()` per pool.
17. Concentrated pools: **decided 2026-08-26 — index the positions.**
    `position_update` carries holder + tick range + liquidity delta; state is
    one GROUP BY (712 open positions, 273 holders, 26 pools). List returns
    positions, header counts holders; constant pools are the degenerate
    one-position case. Open positions only; raw L + price range (no
    token-amount conversion until it passes an on-chain check).
    `ParticipantItem` gains optional range fields; shares become optional.

**F. API**

18. `PoolItem.pool_id` widens from the SEP-23 `L…` strkey to also carry a `C…`
    contract address; add protocol + pool type. **api-types regen.**
19. Legs become a list, not `asset_a`/`asset_b` — 3-token stable pools exist.
20. List endpoint unions classic + Aquarius; `filter[protocol]`.
21. Detail, participants and activity endpoints routed per protocol.

**G. Frontend**

22. Pool route accepts a `C…` id.
23. Classic / Soroban filter in `PoolsFilterBar`.
24. `PoolAssetPair` renders N legs; pool-type badge.
25. Participants empty state per E17.

**H. History gap**

26. Attempt the backwards reconstruction on the 79 gap pools; accept only pools
    whose walk lands on the first known snapshot exactly. The rest render null
    reserves before their first snapshot ledger, labelled.

**I. Records**

27. ADR for the two new tables and the shape-driven discovery rule.
28. `docs/architecture/**` — schema, read path, frontend contract.
29. `docs/backfills.md` — the three in-DB backfills, flavour A, no re-parse.

## Reserves come from ledger state, not from event arithmetic — 2026-08-21

Supersedes the reconstruction approach sketched earlier in this file. The
earlier design tried to predict how each event moved the reserves. That is now
unnecessary, and the measurements below are why.

### The finding

A pool's reserves are **stored on ledger**. Decoding the `TransactionMeta` of a
real swap (`a46f2c7f…4980`, ledger 64 052 779) shows a persistent
`ContractData` entry owned by `CCABO2IQ…JROY` — the Aquarius "pools plane" —
keyed `[Symbol("PoolData"), Address(pool)]`:

```
reserves  -> [1044176401956, 353830778]   identical to the announced values
pool_type -> "standard"
init_args -> [10]                          fee, basis points
```

The plane contract was **deployed at ledger 52 728 369**, before the first
Aquarius trade (52 728 694) and ~4.85 M ledgers before the first
`update_reserves` event (57 573 730). Its documented job is to be updated on
every pool action.

### Why this replaces the reconstruction

| Reconstruct from events                                                | Read the state                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| predict each event's effect on reserves                                | read the reserves                     |
| fee semantics per pool type **and per contract version**               | none                                  |
| ±1 per-event error compounding over 921 119 steps                      | independent snapshots                 |
| partial by nature — pools failing the zero-landing test keep "no data" | every pool, whole history             |
| indirect proof                                                         | the value the contract itself reports |

It also yields `pool_type` and the fee parameter from the same entry, so pool
metadata stops depending on event archaeology.

### What the abandoned path had already established

Kept because it is the evidence that the arithmetic route was a dead end, and
because two of the results stay useful:

- **Trade rule fitted per pool type against 91 181 clean single-event intervals:**
  constant `Δin = amount_in − fee`; stable `− ceil(fee/2)`; concentrated
  `− floor(fee/2)`. Out-leg is exactly `−amount_out` in **100 %** of cases,
  all types. Stable matched 20 688/20 688 exactly; concentrated
  31 362/31 510; constant only 23 436/38 983 exactly (rest off by 1).
- **The residual has a name.** Balance derived purely from CAP-67 token
  transfers minus the announced reserves equalled `get_protocol_fees()` **to
  the unit** (32 902 811) on the sampled pool. So
  `reserves = transfer-derived balance − accrued protocol fee`. Retained as a
  **cross-check**, not as a mechanism.
- **The oracle test that killed the approach.** Predicting each pool's accrued
  protocol fee from its whole event history and comparing with on-chain
  `get_protocol_fees()`: **6 of 49 pool-token cases exact**. Small misses are
  rounding (3, 11, 136 against balances in the billions); large ones are 12×
  and 30× and are **not** explained by fee claims — only one of the diverging
  pools has any `claim_protocol_fee` event at all. Most likely the `fee`
  field's meaning changed across contract versions, and pools were upgraded
  many times. A rule per contract version, with no published source, is not a
  foundation.

### Open question — must be settled by a pilot, not assumed

The pool interface exposes **`backfill_plane_data()`**. That function exists
for a reason: plane data was probably not populated for every pool from the
start. So "the plane was deployed early" does **not** prove "the plane carried
every pool's reserves from the start".

Settle it with a **pilot re-parse of a small slice** inside the gap window
(~10 k ledgers) and check whether `PoolData` changes appear for pools trading
in that slice. Cheap, and it decides whether the full re-parse is worth
running. Do not run the full pass first.

### Revised order

1. Parser extracts the plane's `ContractData` changes from the ledger entry
   change list — an extension of the existing `ContractData` handling that
   already reads token balances, not a new mechanism.
2. Verify on the live path: indexer-captured plane state vs `get_reserves()`
   on chain. Same comparison that already matched to the unit on three pools
   across all three pool types.
3. **Pilot re-parse** of a ~10 k-ledger slice inside the gap window; confirm
   `PoolData` entries are present there.
4. Only then the full re-parse of 52 728 369 → 57 573 730 (~4.85 M ledgers).
   Operator task, not an agent task. `repair-tier1` after any `--reindex` run
   is mandatory (`docs/backfills.md`), indexer stopped.

**Decided 2026-08-27: plane state is the single reserve source for the whole
timeline** — live and historical, one decode, no stitch at 57 573 730.
`update_reserves` events become a monitored cross-check (same announced
values; alarm on divergence; coverage from 57 573 730 onward — before that,
checkpoint snapshots are the only oracle). Events stay the source for volume,
where the amounts are read rather than inferred. The pilot behind this: 80/80
router-A pools had `PoolData` in their first trade ledger in both sampled gap
slices, and router B's pools sit in a second, deployment-own plane
(`CDWVENDO…WN5C`, 8/8) — so plane discovery keys on the
`[Symbol("PoolData"), Address(pool)]` shape, never a hard-coded address.

---

## Verification pass — 2026-08-26

Independent re-measurement of the findings above, prompted by an adversarial
review that assumed they were wrong. Each figure is a single-pass query over
`soroban_events` (10.3 G rows) with explicit deduplication. Two of the three
challenges were refuted by the data; the router counts in the first block do
need correcting.

### Correction: an earlier join was inflated by unmerged RMT rows

`soroban_contracts` carries duplicate rows — merges are healthy, the parts are
simply never collapsed to one. An `INNER JOIN` on it multiplies event rows by
roughly 4. Any count reached through that join is wrong by that factor unless
taken with `uniqExact` / `DISTINCT`. Everything below is deduplicated.

### Routers: ten, not two — but eight are dead

| `CALJOHJU…KLDN` |     3 | constant                       |   50 772 154 |  50 772 158 |

**496 registered pools, not 410.** The documented router holds **339, not 337**.

Of the 84 pools registered by the eight undocumented routers: 5 ever emitted
`update_reserves`, newest activity at ledger 60 697 845, **none** active in the
last million ledgers, 210 reserve events in total. Those eight are historically
dead, so a two-router scope loses nothing live — and loses those 5 pools and
210 events from a complete history, which is the standard this project holds
itself to.

**A fourth pool type exists.** `CCPHUHQY…I7SE` registers `elastic` alongside
`constant`. The earlier claim that no other variants exist across all history
is false as written. Any match on pool type must be total; `elastic` must not
land in a default arm.

### The registry is complete — zero orphans

|                                          |       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----: |
| registered pools, all ten routers        |   496 |
| pools emitting `update_reserves`         |   373 |
| **emitting but registered by no router** | **0** |
| registered but never traded              |   123 |

Registry-driven discovery is sufficient, provided every router is found. The
shape-driven rule stated earlier is still the right rule — it is what surfaces
the ten — but the orphan arm (step A3) has no known work to do today. Keep it
as a monitored path, not as a load-bearing assumption.

Step A5 cannot establish this on its own: it diffs the table against the same
registries that filled it, so a pool no router registered would be invisible to
both sides. The zero above comes from the independent shape side
(`update_reserves` emitters). That is the comparison A5 should make.

### Concentrated pools: an adoption curve, not a sampling artefact

Trades per ~500 k-ledger window, by pool type:

| Window |  Trades | constant | stable | concentrated | % conc. |
| -----: | ------: | -------: | -----: | -----------: | ------: |
|    116 | 265 570 |  237 647 | 27 923 |            0 |       0 |
|    120 | 204 822 |  168 709 | 36 108 |            0 |       0 |
|    122 | 259 589 |  208 208 | 51 381 |            0 |       0 |
|    123 | 229 956 |  188 359 | 41 578 |           19 |       0 |
|    124 | 241 793 |  184 498 | 47 962 |        9 333 |     3.9 |
|    125 | 436 390 |  268 643 | 32 439 |      135 308 |    31.0 |
|    126 | 417 163 |  199 210 | 49 645 |      168 308 |    40.3 |
|    127 | 226 021 |   91 183 | 65 752 |       69 086 |    30.6 |
|    128 | 181 375 |   89 165 | 21 690 |       70 520 |    38.9 |

Zero to ~39 % in five windows, then a plateau at 30–40 %. `constant` falls in
absolute terms across the same span (237 k → 89 k), so concentrated is taking
flow rather than adding it. The "constant-only is not defensible" conclusion
holds, and if anything understates the case.

### Still unverified — settle before the participants work

Share-token coverage. The participants finding rests on a single pool matching
`get_total_shares()` exactly. How many constant pools have a share token
actually present in `assets` was not measured — the hourly read quota ran out.
Until it is measured, an unresolvable share token must render "not indexed";
an empty holder list is indistinguishable from a pool that genuinely has none.

## Schema + API review — 2026-08-27

An adversarial review of the two proposed table shapes and the API contract,
run before any DDL was written. Verdict: **ship with changes**. Three findings
were severe enough to invalidate the atomic steps as written; all were
re-verified independently before being accepted.

### 1. The proposed sort key would have deleted ~a quarter of every fact table

`ORDER BY (pool_id, ledger_sequence)` on a ReplacingMergeTree collapses rows
sharing that key, and without a version column the survivor is arbitrary.
Measured over the newest million ledgers:

| Event             |    Rows | Distinct `(pool, ledger)` |       Lost |
| ----------------- | ------: | ------------------------: | ---------: |
| `trade`           | 192 399 |                   146 768 | **23.7 %** |
| `update_reserves` | 194 230 |                   148 491 | **23.5 %** |

Up to 12 reserve updates land in one ledger for one pool. **Every fact table
here keys on `(pool_id, ledger_sequence, transaction_id, event_index)`** — the
shape `soroban_events` already uses. This is the same silent-loss class the
classic snapshots table has carried unnoticed.

### 2. Four tables, not two

Steps A1 and B6 named DDL for the registry and for reserves. Volume (step C)
and concentrated positions (step E) had none — they were written as if they
would insert into tables nobody had defined. Both need DDL in the same
operator session, with the key from finding 1.

### 3. Widening `pool_id` yields a valid-looking wrong address, not an error

`pool_id_hex_to_strkey` (`crates/api/src/common/strkey.rs:74`) wraps any
32-byte payload as a `LiquidityPool` strkey. A contract id is also 32 bytes, so
it passes the length assert and renders a **well-formed `L…` address for a pool
that does not exist** — no panic, no error. A `pool_kind` discriminator is
required, and `is_hex_pool_id` / `pool_id_from_text` need the same branch.

### 4. `pool_type` has two vocabularies in our own evidence

The router's `add_pool` says `constant`; the pool-state entry for the same pool
says `standard`. Since plane state is now the single reserve source (T4), one
column would collect both spellings. **Reversed 2026-08-27.** The decoder now
keeps only the raw spelling and normalises nothing: three vocabularies are live
at once (`constant` in the event, `standard` in pool state, `ConstantProduct`
in the contract's own enum), and asserting they mean the same thing is an
interpretation, not a decoding. It belongs wherever one vocabulary is actually
needed, not in the path every event crosses. Measured afterwards: `standard`
appears in **zero** of the 497 `add_pool` payloads, so the folding arm was
unreachable code justified by a source it could never see.

### 5. The orphan arm can clobber a registry row

Under RMT, a stub written by the orphan arm (step A3) at a later ledger wins
over the real registration. Dormant today (zero orphans measured) but the
schema must not permit it: use `AggregatingMergeTree` with
`SimpleAggregateFunction(max/min)` per column — house precedent is `asset_sac`.
Add `last_activity_ledger` while there: the classic pool list has no usable
order key precisely because that column is missing.

### 6. The two-leg assumption is wider than the DTO, and `i64` overflows

Beyond `PoolItem`: `PoolEvent::from_signs(i64, i64)` is the whole
deposit/withdraw/trade classifier and would mislabel an imbalanced three-leg
deposit as a trade. `PoolActivityItem.amount_a: i64` cannot hold the
18-decimal leg already on chain (1.28e24 against an `i64::MAX` of 9.22e18).
Also `reserve_a`/`reserve_b`, the chart TVL formula, `fetch_pool_asset_ids ->
(i64, i64)`, and five frontend files. Step 21 covers only the DTO and must be
widened to the classifier and the amount types.

### 7. Empty-string `protocol` is a misleading fallback

Decided in T2 as "assert nothing", but an empty string is indistinguishable
from a missing filter value and renders as a blank rather than an absence. Use
`Option<String>` / SQL NULL, which says the same thing without pretending to be
a value. Same for `shares` becoming optional: `PoolParticipants.tsx:40` calls
`formatAmount(row.shares)` unconditionally and needs the null branch.

### Also noted

The registry moved from 496 to 497 pools during the review — the same live
drift that took router A from 339 to 340 earlier. Not a discrepancy; every
count in this file carries its measurement time.

`clickhouse` 0.15 round-trips `Array(Int128)` correctly, but no such column
exists in this database yet, so it warrants an integration test rather than an
assumption.

---

## Step 1b — what a slot is, and why the registry keys on the pool

Settled 2026-08-27 by measurement, because the DDL depends on it.

A registration carries a `subpool_salt`: the key the router addresses a pool by
within one token set. It is tempting to treat `(tokens, salt)` as the pool's
identity. **It is not.**

|                                                             |        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -----: |
| registrations                                               |    497 |
| distinct pool addresses                                     |    497 |
| distinct salts                                              | **81** |
| slots (`tokens` + `salt`) registered more than once         |     18 |
| pools living in those slots                                 |     65 |
| of those, never active                                      |     29 |
| **slots with two pools active in the last million ledgers** |  **3** |

A slot gets re-pointed when a pool is redeployed, and one slot was re-pointed
seven times. The obvious simplification — "the current pool for a slot is its
newest registration" — is **false**: three slots have two pools trading at
once. So the salt is a plain attribute. **The pool contract address is the
identity**, and there it is clean: 497 registrations, 497 distinct addresses,
no pool registered twice.

## Step 1 — the DDL, and the two decisions inside it

### Three tables, not four

Concentrated positions get **no table**. They are 13 801 `position_update`
events across 26 pools, and the contract-id filter is a sort-key prefix, so a
live aggregation is cheap on both the detail page and the list. Recorded as a
decision rather than left as a gap.

### Why `AggregatingMergeTree` and not the usual `ReplacingMergeTree`

The registry has two writers with different authority: `add_pool` writes a full
row, and the orphan arm writes a stub for a contract that trades without a
registration. Under RMT versioned on a ledger the **stub wins**, because it is
written later by construction — and a fully-populated pool silently degrades to
no router, no type, no legs, with the good row deleted on merge. Dormant today
(zero orphans measured) which is the dangerous kind: it fires during a backfill
months from now.

With `SimpleAggregateFunction(max, …)` an empty value loses unconditionally, so
a stub can only ever _add_ information. House precedent is `asset_sac`.

This also settles the empty-vs-null argument for `protocol`. T2 chose an empty
string to assert nothing about an unidentified deployment; the schema review
argued for NULL as the less misleading value. The engine decides it: `max` over
`Nullable` does not give the "empty always loses" property, and an empty string
does. **Empty string, for a mechanical reason rather than a stylistic one.**

### The DDL — operator runs these

```sql
-- Registry. One row per pool contract; the salt is an attribute, not a key.
CREATE TABLE soroban_pools
(
    pool_id              Int64,
    pool_address         SimpleAggregateFunction(max, String),
    protocol             SimpleAggregateFunction(max, LowCardinality(String)),
    deployment_id        SimpleAggregateFunction(max, Int64),
    pool_type_raw        SimpleAggregateFunction(max, LowCardinality(String)),
    token_ids            SimpleAggregateFunction(max, Array(Int64)),
    subpool_salt         SimpleAggregateFunction(max, String),
    init_args            SimpleAggregateFunction(max, Array(String)),
    fee_bps              SimpleAggregateFunction(max, Int32),
    share_token_id       SimpleAggregateFunction(max, Int64),
    plane_id             SimpleAggregateFunction(max, Int64),
    first_seen_ledger    SimpleAggregateFunction(min, Int64),
    last_activity_ledger SimpleAggregateFunction(max, Int64)
)
ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree
ORDER BY pool_id;

-- Reserves, read from pool-plane state. The key carries the transaction and
-- the intra-transaction index: (pool, ledger) alone collapses 23.5% of rows.
CREATE TABLE pool_state_changes
(
    pool_id          Int64,
    ledger_sequence  Int64,
    transaction_id   Int64,
    event_index      Int16,
    reserves         Array(Int128),
    plane_id         Int64
)
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree
PARTITION BY intDiv(ledger_sequence, 5000000)
ORDER BY (pool_id, ledger_sequence, transaction_id, event_index);

-- Volume. Same key discipline: (pool, ledger) alone collapses 23.7%.
CREATE TABLE soroban_pool_trades
(
    pool_id          Int64,
    ledger_sequence  Int64,
    transaction_id   Int64,
    event_index      Int16,
    token_in_id      Int64,
    token_out_id     Int64,
    amount_in        Int128,
    amount_out       Int128,
    fee              Int128,
    caller_id        Int64
)
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree
PARTITION BY intDiv(ledger_sequence, 5000000)
ORDER BY (pool_id, ledger_sequence, transaction_id, event_index);
```

### Column notes worth keeping

- **`init_args Array(String)`** — raw and unparsed, because the list is three
  vocabularies wearing one shape (`[u32]`, `[u32, i32]`, `[u32, u128]`,
  `[u32, u128, u32]`). Position 1 is a tick spacing in one pool type and an
  amplification factor in another, and `u128` does not fit `i64`.
- **`fee_bps`** is the one safe extraction: position 0 is a `u32` fee in all
  eight measured shapes.
- **`pool_type_raw`** only. No normalised twin: three spellings exist across
  three sources, and deciding they mean the same thing is an interpretation
  that belongs where one vocabulary is actually needed.
- **`caller_id`, not `trader_id`** — topic 4 of `trade` is the caller, which on
  router-mediated swaps is the router.
- **`plane_id`** on both tables — planes are per deployment, so the pool's
  reserve source is not a constant.
- **`last_activity_ledger`** — the classic list has no usable order key
  precisely because this column is missing there; deriving it later would mean
  a full snapshot `GROUP BY`.

## Committed follow-through — the pair columns die (decided 2026-08-28)

Not deferred-as-in-maybe: the end state is **`legs` as the only leg source in
both worlds**, and the six pair-shaped columns
(`asset_a_type/code/issuer_id`, `asset_b_*`) **dropped**. Sequence, each step
with its own verifier:

1. resolve whether our `hash64` surrogate == ClickHouse `cityHash64`
   (one sample comparison decides SQL-mutation vs Rust job),
2. backfill `legs` for the 52,620 classic rows,
3. migrate the ~612 pair-shaped call sites (API queries, classifier,
   frontend) to `legs` — the largest piece, behind a read-time coalesce
   bridge so it can land incrementally,
4. `ALTER TABLE liquidity_pools DROP COLUMN asset_a_type, …` (operator) +
   drop from `init.sql`, the row struct, and the column-order guard together
   — the guard test (`column_order_liquidity_pools`) enforces that these
   three can only move in lockstep.

`init.sql` cannot lose the columns earlier: the driver validates inserts
against the live table (0310), so the struct must keep the fields until the
prod columns are dropped, and the guard pins struct ↔ init.sql.

## Step 18 amended — positions are materialized, not query-time (2026-08-28)

Prior-art sweep (wayfinder `answers/R-position-model-prior-art.md`): the
one-Position-entity-with-nullable-ticks API shape is exactly Messari's
standardized DEX-AMM schema, so it stays. But NO online-serving system folds
positions from raw events at query time — everything materializes. At 13 801
events the fold is cheap today; the design still diverges from every system
that serves this. Amended: a rebuildable projection, fed by a materialized
view over the events already ingested — no new ingest code.

Operator DDL (runs together with the still-pending registry ALTER):

```sql
CREATE TABLE soroban_pool_positions
(
    pool_id   Int64,
    holder_id Int64,
    tick_lo   Int32,
    tick_hi   Int32,
    liquidity SimpleAggregateFunction(sum, Int128),
    last_updated_ledger SimpleAggregateFunction(max, Int64)
)
ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree
ORDER BY (pool_id, holder_id, tick_lo, tick_hi);
```

(The MV definition over `soroban_events` follows with the step-18
implementation; the table is rebuildable from the events at any time, so a
wrong projection is a re-fill, never a re-parse.)

The participants DTO gains an explicit position-kind discriminator rather
than inferring fungible-vs-ranged from null ticks (research amendment 2).

---

## DEPTH-FIRST — the governing principle from here on (Karol, 2026-08-28)

One protocol at a time, one deployment at a time, built end-to-end. Analysis
may look wide; **building may not**. Nothing lands "because the next protocol
will need it" — the next protocol updates the model when its turn comes, and
the diff then shows exactly what differed. 0516 remains analysis and ground
rules only, never a shared build.

This reversed a same-day drift. The registry had grown to nine columns, a
deployments dimension and a positions projection — cut back to what the first
protocol needs:

**The one DDL that exists now** (replaces every earlier DDL block in this
file; none of the earlier ones ever reached production):

```sql
ALTER TABLE liquidity_pools
    ADD COLUMN pool_kind      UInt8                  DEFAULT 0,
    ADD COLUMN legs           Array(Int64)           DEFAULT [],
    ADD COLUMN deployment_id  Int64                  DEFAULT 0,
    ADD COLUMN pool_type_raw  LowCardinality(String) DEFAULT '',
    ADD COLUMN share_token_id Int64                  DEFAULT 0;
```

Why each of the five is needed by Aquarius alone: `pool_kind` renders the id
honestly (a contract payload otherwise renders as a valid-looking wrong L…
strkey); `legs` because Aquarius stable pools carry 3 and 4 legs today;
`deployment_id` because two live routers share Aquarius's code and only one
is Aquarius (T1) — and with the venue label resolved from this id at read
time (a reviewed constant in the API, not a stored string), a new pool is
labelled the moment it registers, which kills both the editorial-UPDATE drift
and the label column; `pool_type_raw` gates the participants path (fungible
vs concentrated) and the meaning of the tick parameter; `share_token_id`
feeds the fungible participants read (T6).

**Cut, with the reason recorded:**

- `subpool_salt`, `init_args` — registration provenance; the `add_pool` event
  sits complete and forever in `soroban_events`. Extract on demand, never
  copy. (`fee_bps` is the one operational value, already extracted.)
- `protocol` column — replaced by read-time resolution from `deployment_id`;
  a stored label needs a re-run editorial UPDATE for every new pool and
  drifts in between.
- a `soroban_pool_registry` subtype side table (moving
  `deployment_id`/`pool_type_raw`/`share_token_id` out of the wide row) —
  textbook-cleaner, but it pays a JOIN on the hottest path (the union list
  with type/deployment filters), ClickHouse's own guidance is to denormalise,
  and the table already carries classic-only columns the same way (`assets`
  does too: `contract_id`=0 on classic rows, empty code/issuer on soroban —
  the discriminator says which columns apply). **Revisit at the legs
  migration**, when the six classic-only columns drop and the JOIN cost can
  be measured on the real list.
- `amm_deployments` table — a good idea _when a second protocol arrives_;
  today it would hold two rows serving one JOIN. Revisit at the Phoenix
  adapter, not before.
- `soroban_pool_positions` + its MV — concentrated participants are LAST in
  Aquarius scope (Karol). The prior-art verdict (materialize, explicit
  position-kind discriminator) is recorded in T5 and stands for whenever
  that work starts; nothing is built until then.

## Step-4 ordering rule (Karol caught this, 2026-08-28)

**The backfill runs ONLY after the step-3 writer is live on production, and
the corpus is re-harvested at that moment.** Order: deploy writer → harvest
`add_pool` corpus (now covering everything up to the writer's start) →
generate → insert. A pool registering between an early insert and the deploy
would be silently missing; the reverse overlap is harmless because the RMT
key (`pool_id`, version `last_updated_ledger`) makes the insert idempotent.
The generated file is disposable — one `chq` + one `cargo run` recreates it
in seconds, so nothing is "saved" by inserting early.

## Step-15 design constraint — filling `share_token_id` must not clobber (Karol caught this, 2026-08-28)

The registry is RMT: merges keep whole rows, so a later partial row wins whole.
A deposit-path writer that knows ONLY the share token cannot write a registry
row — it would replace legs/type/deployment with defaults. The three honest
options, in house terms:

1. **Side table, the `asset_sac` pattern** (different writer, different
   rhythm → side table with column-merge semantics): a tiny
   `pool_share_tokens (pool_id, share_token_id, derived_at_ledger)` RMT keyed
   on `pool_id`, written by the deposit path which has both values in hand;
   reads join ~500 rows. The `share_token_id` column added by the ALTER then
   stays unwritten and is dropped at the legs migration. **Recommended.**
2. In-DB periodic backfill that reconstructs FULL rows
   (`INSERT … SELECT` joining the current row + the derivation) — no clobber,
   but the token appears with batch delay and the job is a new moving part.
3. Read-modify-write in the deposit path — racy against concurrent
   registration updates and already rejected as a pattern in this project.

Decide at step 15; nothing writes the column until then, so today it is
harmless either way.

## `fee_bps` silent-zero (Karol, 2026-08-28)

`init_args[0].parse().unwrap_or(0)` turns an unparseable fee into a plausible
0 — the misleading-fallback class. Bounded today: the corpus test pins all
eight mainnet shapes (u32 at position 0 in every one), so a silent zero can
only come from a FUTURE shape. Amendment for step 15's commit train: warn in
`pool_registry_row` when position 0 is absent or unparseable, so the zero is
always accompanied by an alarm-visible log line.

## Final-phase step: prove the deploy window is closed (Karol, 2026-08-28)

After the writer deploys and the catch-up backfill re-runs, one read-only
check proves no registration slipped between the working backfill and the
writer's start — the gap the batched-deploy plan makes possible:

```sql
SELECT
  (SELECT uniqExact(JSONExtractString(data_xdr,'value',1,'value'))
     FROM soroban_events WHERE signature = 'add_pool')      AS zdarzen,
  (SELECT uniqExact(pool_id) FROM liquidity_pools
     WHERE pool_kind = 1)                                   AS w_rejestrze,
  zdarzen - w_rejestrze                                     AS brakuje  -- MUSI byc 0
```

Non-zero `brakuje` = re-run the generator + insert (idempotent) and re-check.

**Amendment (three-lens review, 2026-09-01):** the generator CANNOT perform
the router corroboration the live writer does (instance storage is not in
`soroban_events`), so before its insert the backfill session must (a) re-run
the "no pool registered twice" measurement over `add_pool` — a duplicate
registration naming an already-registered pool would beat the genuine row on
RMT merge and the closure check above (uniqExact) is blind to it — and
(b) refuse duplicates in the generator (one GROUP BY). Zero duplicates
measured 2026-09-01; this guards the window between that measurement and the
writer's start.
The generator itself is deliberately NOT in the tree (a one-off is not a
maintained surface — Karol, 2026-08-28); resurrect it verbatim for the final
phase with:
`git show 082ee364:crates/db-clickhouse/src/bin/gen_pool_registry_backfill.rs`
This lands in the T7 production checklist, not only here.

## Step-15 fundamental correction — the chain stores the relation as STATE (2026-08-28)

Karol pushed past "which table" to "where does the truth live". Probed on raw
ledger meta (registration ledger 63 893 403, pool `CBMWU357…`):

**The pool's own instance storage, written IN THE SAME TRANSACTION as
`add_pool`, carries the whole registration as state:**

```
TokenShare  = CC5PU23M…   ← the share token, at birth
Plane       = CCABO2IQ…      TokenA/TokenB, FeeFraction,
Router      = CBQDHNBF…      ReserveA/ReserveB, TotalShares, …
```

And a concentrated pool's instance (probed at 64 134 576) has **no
`TokenShare` key at all** — instead `Slot0`, `TickSpacing`, `Liquidity`,
`FeeGrowthGlobal…`. The absence is structural, matching `share_id()`
returning the pool itself.

### Revised design — T4's rule applied to its own conclusion

- **Source: instance-storage `TokenShare`** (state), not the deposit⇄mint
  correlation. Available at the creation ledger and, for the 13 measured
  migrations, as later instance-update entries. "State over inference" — the
  same reasoning that decided reserves.
- **Store: the `pool_share_tokens` side table stands** — the relation is
  mutable and the registry is whole-row RMT, so the structural argument is
  untouched; only the WRITER changes.
- **The T6 deposit-mint detector is demoted to a monitored cross-check** —
  exactly `update_reserves`' fate in T4. Its 16/16 on-chain verification is
  what makes it a trustworthy alarm.
- **Implementation folds into step 7**: the instance-entry arm is the same
  ContractData extraction family as the plane read, so share tokens, plane_id
  and reserve corroboration ride one pathway. Before implementing, probe one
  EARLY-era pool (52.7M) for storage-layout drift across contract versions.

### Anchor upgrade (2026-08-28): shares-first is the vendor's own word

The 0008 capture of `liquidity_pool_events` carries the impl comment for
`deposit_liquidity`: body `[stake_amount, amountA, amountB, amountC]` —
shares FIRST, in the vendor's own source. The claim previously stood on
measurement alone (75 200/75 200); it now stands on source + measurement.

## Step-7 deep verification (2026-08-29) — and one layout discovery

79 raw mainnet ledgers through the compiled pipeline (`pool_state_real_corpus`):
both T3 pilot slices plus 11 registration ledgers picked across every era and
type. Results:

- **267 plane writes, 269 pool instances, zero PoolData-shaped entries the
  parser refused** — the silent-loss invariant held everywhere.
- **The recorded early-era probe PASSES**: dead-deployment registrations
  (50.6M) and the first Aquarius pools (52.7M) parse with the same storage
  keys as today's. No layout drift across contract versions.
- **TokenShare presence matches pool type 269/269**: fungible (constant 220,
  stable 44, elastic 1) → present; concentrated (4) → absent. Elastic carries
  a share token — consistent with its deposits minting.
- **Dual-source oracle** (plane state vs `update_reserves` events, the
  event-era overlap): every comparable row agrees on the reserve values.

**Discovery: a concentrated pool's plane `reserves` vector is reserves AS A
PREFIX plus per-tick state in the tail** (measured: `[r0, r1, 0…]` and
`[r0, r1, tick liquidity…]` vs the event's exact `[r0, r1]`). The snapshot
writer stores the vector RAW (state verbatim); reads slice by the pool's leg
count. Nothing may treat vector length as leg count.

## T4 refined by the anti-test (2026-08-29): concentrated reserves ride the INSTANCE

The bidirectional set-equality anti-test (extracted state vs `update_reserves`
events, per ledger, both directions) caught a real architecture gap: **a
concentrated pool does NOT update the plane per operation.** Probed raw on a
hot ledger: 8 instance rewrites (`Reserve0`/`Reserve1`, `TickChunk`s), zero
plane writes for the busiest concentrated pool. The plane gets their
`PoolData` at registration only. T3's 80/80 pilot could not see this — the
first concentrated pool registered AFTER the gap era the pilot sampled; the
one-source claim was a generalization beyond its sample.

Refinement (implemented): reserves source is per pool layout —
**fungible → plane `PoolData`; concentrated → instance `Reserve0/Reserve1`**
(same extraction family, same snapshot table, `plane_id` still carried). The
fungible instance's `ReserveA/B` mirror is deliberately NOT staged (the plane
is their source; staging both would duplicate rows) — it remains a
corroborator.

Final verification state for step 7:

- 90 raw ledgers through the compiled pipeline; zero shaped-but-unparseable;
- raw registration ledger → full STAGING → exact rows (values, change_index,
  plane_id, share relation);
- anti-test: **zero foreign contracts captured** (instances outside the
  registry: 0; the only set-differences are registrations, where the plane is
  created before any event exists);
- **zero pools missed** after the refinement;
- last-write-per-ledger reserves equal the last `update_reserves` event
  **17/17** in the event-era overlap;
- TokenShare-vs-type: 285/285 instances consistent (fungible → present,
  concentrated → absent).

## Why snapshots stay TWO tables while pools became one (Karol challenged, 2026-08-29)

Dimensional rule: unify by entity when the GRAIN matches; separate facts when
it differs. The pool dimension shared its grain (one row = one pool). The
snapshot facts do not: classic = one deterministic row per (pool, ledger)
(the 0356 LIMIT-1/no-FINAL invariant depends on it); soroban = one row per
state write, up to 12/ledger (collapsing loses 23.5%). Value models are
disjoint too (Decimal(38,7) + write-time analytics vs verbatim Array(Int128)).
Unifying would need a sort-key change = a 322M-row rebuild, and — the
clincher — **no cross-kind snapshot read exists**: charts and cross-checks
are per pool, and the pool's kind is known from the registry first. The
union cost that justified one dimension table does not exist for these facts.
Considered and rejected: write-side collapse to classic grain (loses real
intermediate states; adds a kind-conditional invariant to a versionless RMT).
Revisit trigger: a query that genuinely needs a cross-kind snapshot union.

### Reframed after the greenfield pass (2026-08-29): target + parallel legacy model

Corrected after a devil's-advocate pass (senior-principal framing) — the
first draft of this section had three real errors:

**Greenfield is TWO fact tables, not one.** A pure state table cannot
reconstruct volume: a reserve delta does not distinguish a trade from a
deposit/withdrawal — only the indexer, seeing the operation, can attribute
it. That is exactly what `gross_volume_a` encodes today (read-time tvl /
volume / fee_revenue in `queries.rs` are all derived from indexer-written
inputs). So `gross_volume_a` is a FACT living in the wrong table, not an
accretion. From scratch:

- `pool_state_changes(pool_id, ledger, tx, change_index, reserves Array(Int128), total_shares)`
  — verbatim chain state at chain grain, both families. `total_shares`
  BELONGS here for classic: it is a field of the same `LiquidityPoolEntry`
  (same source, same write, same grain); for Soroban the column is absent /
  from its own source. The first draft wrongly exiled it.
- `pool_trades(pool_id, ledger, tx, …, gross_amounts)` — trade attribution
  fact (Soroban already has this via events; classic's lives fused into the
  snapshot row as `gross_volume_a`).

Real accretions remain: write-time Decimal(38,7) scaling and the collapsed
per-ledger grain (an 0356 write-side choice, not chain shape).

**`pool_state_changes` matches the target state-fact shape**, so the two
current tables are the target model + a PARALLEL legacy-shaped model — not
peers-forever. Deliberately NOT labelled "legacy to migrate" and no
migration task filed (no-speculative-backlog rule): unification is
trigger-gated. Triggers: first consumer needing one cross-family history
read; or repair-tier1 cost outweighing a rebuild (its 12 MIN-semantics
columns are mostly the fused accretions and would retire). Until then every
pool-history endpoint carries a per-kind branch — a real, named, ongoing
cost, accepted.

**No in-band sentinels on import.** If classic history ever imports at
ledger grain, it must carry an explicit source discriminator (nullable
tx/change or a `source` column), never `tx=0/change=0` — magic zeros are the
same bug class as the native empty-string convention that hid 21.7% of
pools.

Step 7 code is unaffected by all of the above.

**Rename (2026-08-29, pre-DDL so free):** `soroban_pool_snapshots` →
`pool_state_changes` (struct `PoolStateChangeRow`). The only decision from the
greenfield pass that would have forced later churn was the NAME — after a
unification the family prefix lies. Everything else (classic migration,
`pool_trades` split, `total_shares`/`source` columns) is additive later, so
deferred. Historical mentions above read as the new name.

## Steps 8/9 — formally closed by the deep-testing record (2026-08-29)

The step-7 verification above IS the reserve verification: 90-ledger raw
corpus through the compiled pipeline (0 shaped-unparseable), raw-ledger →
staged-rows e2e with exact values, and the bidirectional anti-test against
`update_reserves` (missing 0, foreign 0, TokenShare-vs-type 285/285,
last-write-per-ledger values 17/17). The standing cross-check monitor query
(extraction vs events per ledger) lives in that section; run it after any
parser change touching pool state.

## Steps 16-20 — read path, frontend, docs (2026-08-29, one session)

- **API** (steps 16-17-19): list + detail publish `pool_kind` / `protocol`
  (verified-operator label, read-time resolve from `deployment_id`) /
  `pool_type` / `legs[]` (resolver live-verified on prod: both arms, 8/8
  legs incl. an 18-decimals bespoke token); pair fields null on soroban
  rows; `participant_count` null (≠ 0) where the population is wrong.
  Participants endpoint branches: soroban = share-token holders from
  `balances` (asset-direction full scan measured 121.5M rows / 71 ms; skip
  index on `asset_id` is the [K] upgrade if hot), shares scaled by metadata
  decimals or null, percentage scale-free, cursor rides the raw value.
  Chart + activity REFUSE soroban pools explicitly (400 with reason) —
  never a confidently-empty series. Pool routes accept `L...` AND `C...`
  (a soroban pool's id bytes are a contract payload; an `L...` render would
  be well-formed and WRONG). `pool_exists` retired — every gate needs the
  kind now. OpenAPI + `@rumblefish/api-types` regenerated.
- **Frontend** (step 18): one `poolLegViews` model renders both worlds
  (classic pair expands, soroban `legs[]` scale raw reserves by on-chain
  decimals — unknown scale renders as absent, never raw). List + detail
  render 2-4 legs, protocol chip (verified only), classic-only sections
  (chart/activity) not mounted for soroban. web tests 305/305, typecheck
  and lint clean (3 pre-existing warnings elsewhere).
- **Docs** (step 20): ADR 0058 (discovery shape-first + label-as-attribution;
  one dimension two id worlds; state facts at chain grain; share relation as
  side table; explicit refusals) + database-schema / indexing-pipeline /
  xdr-parsing overviews updated per ADR 0032.

Deferred within scope, still ahead: [K] DDLs, deploy, backfills, gap
re-parse, deploy-window closure check, registry post-backfill audit (old
step 6), concentrated positions (step 23, LAST). Local full-stack visual
verification of the FE against prod CH belongs to the final phase.

## K4-6 measured (2026-08-29): share_percentage is NOT stale — lp_positions coverage is the real gap

Method: per pool, sum of deduped positive `lp_positions` shares vs the
latest snapshot `total_shares` (323.7M rows read, 0.7 s), buckets on the
mismatches, then RAW-XDR chain validation via `getLedgerEntries` (the
arbiter — Horizon untouched).

Findings:

1. **The percentage's denominator is chain-exact.** Two live sampled pools:
   snapshot `total_shares` == the on-chain `LiquidityPoolEntry` value to the
   stroop. Listed holders' percentages are CORRECT. K4-6's "stale
   share_percentage" is refuted as stated.
2. **Zero overcounts.** No pool has positions summing above the chain total
   — no stale-high rows anywhere.
3. **The real defect: missing holders.** 24,920/26,271 pools agree exactly;
   the rest under-sum. 2,681 pools know <50% of the shares' owners (1,164 of
   them LIVE — fresh snapshots), 597 miss 1-50%, 141 drift <1%.
   Chain-validated: pool `0d8a4b61…` has 2 trustlines on chain, we know 0;
   `8e08ca7a…` has 3, we know 2.
4. **Root cause: the ingest floor.** The worst pools' first snapshot is
   exactly L50,458,12x (the frozen backfill floor); a holder whose pool-share
   trustline predates the floor and was never touched since has no
   `lp_positions` row. Same class as every other pre-floor state gap.
   `pos_newer = 0` everywhere — recency is not a factor.

User-visible harm: participants lists are incomplete and
`participant_count` undercounts (2 shown where the chain says 3);
percentages shown are right but do not sum to 100 on affected pools.

Fix direction (not yet decided): pool-share trustlines are ordinary ledger
entries, so a checkpoint snapshot carries ALL of them — a one-shot seed of
the missing `lp_positions` rows from a current checkpoint (the 0457
snapshot toolchain) closes the gap completely, with `first_deposit_ledger`
explicitly unknown for seeded rows (never a fabricated value).

## K4-6 fix MOVED OFF THIS BRANCH (decision karolkow 2026-08-29)

The seed was built here first (commits `a3bc8e63` + `cee04d5a`, reverted in
place — resurrect from those SHAs), then pulled out: it touches ONLY the
CLASSIC world (`LiquidityPoolEntry` + pool-share trustlines are classic
entry types; the soroban-AMM era starts AFTER the ingest floor — first
`add_pool` at L50,638,875 vs floor 50,457,424 — so soroban pools need a
re-parse, never a checkpoint), and this branch ships Aquarius. The work —
folded into the ONE `snapshot-seed` flow, not a side subcommand (same
decision) — now lives in task 0523 (re-scoped), together with the 0468
"Since ledger 0" display bug it half-fixes (94.8% of positions already
carry the 0 sentinel in prod). The K4-6 MEASUREMENT above stands.

## F-B / K2-2 closed by verification (2026-08-29)

The native-leg filter defect was FIXED ALONG THE WAY by tasks 0440/0470:
`asset_codes_predicate` matches native legs by `if(asset_*_type = 0, 'XLM',
asset_*_code)` (one shared definition for the pools list and global search,
unit-tested as load-bearing). Verified on prod, deduped: 11,734 classic
pools carry a native leg (22.3% of 52,663) and EVERY one matches the `XLM`
filter — the formerly invisible set in full. The filter also substring-hits
3,270 pools whose credit code merely contains "XLM" (`yXLM`, `XLMFISH`, …)
— the documented substring semantics every code shares (`USD` matches USDC),
called out on the DTO. Deliberately NOT built: an exact-native-only hatch
(the 0359 "surrogate or type=native" suggestion) — no requester since, and
the per-leg exact mode plus the L/C-id point-select cover the precise cases.
The scope line "in LP snapshots" in this task's summary was loose wording:
the defect lived in the list/search FILTER, and snapshots join by pool_id,
never by leg code.

## Full-stack e2e on real data (2026-08-30) — two shipping-blockers caught, then everything exact

Environment: raw mainnet ledgers (public bucket) → the REAL backfill-runner
binary → local dockerised ClickHouse (full init.sql) → the real API binary
(`bin/local`, new plain-CH branch) → the real SPA in a real browser.
Windows: hot era 64,132,000-200, concentrated-registration era
64,134,500-699, near-tip 64,190,000-64,191,999 (2,401 ledgers, 174k events).

### Bugs the pipeline caught (both invisible to every unit test)

1. **Writer dropped BOTH new tables' rows silently.**
   `PartitionWriter::commit()` hand-lists the inserts to `end()` —
   `pool_share_tokens` and `pool_state_changes` were streamed by
   `write_ledger` but never ended, so their buffered rows vanished on drop
   while the `ledgers` marker still landed. Live indexer shares the path: a
   deploy would have shipped two silently empty tables. Fix: exhaustive
   destructure of `TableInserts` in `commit()` — a future field refuses to
   compile until someone decides where it drains.
2. **The sort key had no intra-ledger order.** `transaction_id` is a hash
   surrogate and sorts randomly; "latest reserves" picked an INTERMEDIATE
   write on 127 of 1,410 real (pool, ledger) pairs (192 pairs carry >1 row).
   Fix (free — prod DDL not yet run): new column `application_order` (tx
   position in its ledger), key becomes
   `(pool, ledger, application_order, change_index)`; `transaction_id`
   stays as a join attribute. API `argMax` follows. Corollary found during
   verification: `soroban_events.event_index` is per-TRANSACTION, so any
   "last event in ledger" comparison must order by
   `(tx application_order, event_index)` — the earlier 17/17 prod check
   passed only because its pairs were single-tx.

### Results after the fixes

- Registry vs vendor API: 248/248 catalogued pools present, pool_type 0
  mismatches under the vocab map, fee 0/248; our 92 extra = dead pools
  (91/92 event-silent since L63M) — full history vs their live subset.
- Full-pipeline bidirectional anti-test vs `update_reserves`:
  **missing 0, values 1,414/1,414 exact** (extras: 1 non-trade write).
- Reserves vs LIVE chain (`getLedgerEntries` at each entry's own
  lastModified): **26/26 exact** (88 pools moved past the windows —
  untestable by construction).
- Share tokens vs live chain `TokenShare`: **92/92** surrogate-exact.
- Live-chain architecture confirmation: concentrated instances carry
  `Reserve0/1` and no `TokenShare`; fungible the reverse, reserves in plane
  `PoolData` (`pool_type: "standard"` — third vocabulary observed live).
- API battery on real data: union list + legs + protocol label + verbatim
  pool_type; explicit 400s (participants-concentrated, chart, activity, bad
  filter value, each with reasons); C-id and L-id routing; absent-valid ids
  404; malformed 400; cursor walk 3 pages no dups and back-page equality;
  XLM filter behaves per F-B.
- Playwright (real data, no mocks; `POOLS_REAL`-gated spec):
  **3/3** — union list row with legs+chip, soroban detail with per-leg
  reserves and classic-only sections unmounted, classic detail intact.

Not covered locally (honest gaps): fungible-pool participants through the
API (no fungible pool REGISTERS inside the windows, so no registry row to
gate on — the SQL path is measured on prod and unit-covered); prices/TVL
(null by design in the local stack).

## Correction (2026-08-30): the classic-legs backfill is a RUST pass, not SQL

The legs-step-2 commit message promised "a cheap in-DB INSERT-SELECT" for
the 52,620 existing classic rows. Wrong — and the legs plan's own step 1
already asked the deciding question: the leg surrogate is our
`cityhash_102_128` low half, and ClickHouse's builtin `cityHash64` is a
DIFFERENT algorithm (ids.rs header), so SQL cannot compute it. The backfill
is a small one-shot Rust pass (read the pair columns, emit rows with legs
filled — versioned on each row's own last_updated_ledger), [K] in the
deploy window alongside the other catch-ups.

## Grain reversal (2026-08-30, decision karolkow): one row per (pool, ledger)

Karol challenged the per-write grain ("czy nie da się jak w klasyce?") and
the re-audit agreed: every consumer that mattered (anti-tests, API latest,
charts) works at ledger grain, and intra-ledger history is permanently
reconstructible from `soroban_events` — the stored intermediates duplicated
it. Collapsed at parse time in apply order (`dedup_final_plane_writes` /
`_pool_instances`, twins of the classic dedup); schema simplified to
`(pool_id, ledger_sequence, reserves, plane_id)`, `application_order` and
the tx columns gone from the table (the ordering-bug class dies with them);
API argMax by ledger alone. Free change — production DDL still did not
exist. Bonus: both worlds now share grain AND mechanism, so the distillation
unification becomes a plain union.

Re-verified end-to-end on the real windows after the collapse: rows==pairs
1,415/1,415 (structural one-per-pair), anti-test values 1,414/1,414,
missing 0, live-chain spot checks 10/10 (the rest moved past the windows),
Playwright 3/3. ADR 0058 §3 rewritten to record the reversal.

## Chart + activity for soroban pools (2026-08-30, decision karolkow: "sprawdź lepiej" → build)

The §5 refusals for the chart and activity feeds did not survive a re-audit:
both are buildable from data already indexed, no new tables.

- **Activity**: the pool's own `trade` / `deposit_liquidity` /
  `withdraw_liquidity` events in `soroban_events` — the table is keyed
  `(contract_id, ledger, transaction_id, event_index)`, so the per-pool page
  is a leading-PK seek. New `leg_amounts[]` on the wire (per-leg signed RAW
  units + `leg_index`; FE scales by each leg's on-chain decimals through the
  unified leg views). Every read `LIMIT 1 BY` (RMT dedup). The actor is the
  TRANSACTION source, never the event's trader topic — measured: routed
  trades put the ROUTER contract there. Cursor gains `event_index`
  (`#[serde(default)]` keeps old classic cursors valid).
- **Chart**: reserves from `pool_state_changes` + the pool's own trade
  events + the SAME prices series the classic chart joins (SAC legs price
  via their classic identities; bespoke tokens under `asset_kind =
'contract'`). Folded in Rust: reserve carry unbounded, price carry ≤ 48 h,
  a bucket with an unpriceable trade reports null volume (house rule — no
  partial sums). Leg ↔ token matching is BY SURROGATE against the registry's
  `legs`, never via the contracts dimension (may lack rows locally).
- Hand-verified exact on the local real-data stack with a stubbed prices DB:
  bucket 08:00 tvl 87,711.33 / volume 204.59 / fee 0.61 (fee_bps = 30) —
  each recomputed by hand from raw reserves × stub closes. Playwright 3/3
  (list, soroban detail with chart tab + Trade rows + linked leg labels,
  classic regression).
- FE: `AmountLegPart` refactored to label/href parts (classic arm keeps
  `assetLegLabel`/`legHref`; soroban arm reads `leg_amounts` through
  `poolLegViews`); the detail-page unmount gates for charts + activity are
  gone. ADR 0058 §5 rewritten (one refusal remains: participants on a pool
  with no known share token).

Finding, out of scope here: for that remaining participants 400 the FE
renders the GENERIC "Something went wrong" retry state — misleading for a
deliberate refusal; it should surface the explanatory message.

## Simplify pass on the soroban feeds (2026-08-31, /simplify — 4 review agents)

Karol challenged the volume of new API code; the four-angle review agreed
and one reuse miss was PROD-BREAKING: the soroban close-series read named
`prices.price_usd_series_1d`, a view that exists only in the local stub —
prod's daily view is `prices.price_usd_series` (verified via chq). The 1d/1w
chart would have 500'd in production. Fixed by extracting the classic
chart's interval→view mapping into `chart_price_series()` shared by both.

Applied (all verified value-identical on the local stack after the rewrite —
bucket 08:00 still tvl 87,711.33 / volume 204.59 / fee 0.61 exact):

- Chart inputs pre-aggregated in CH: reserves argMax per bucket + one seed
  row (pre-window history never crosses the wire), trades summed per
  (bucket, token) with a `bad` parse-failure count so the null-poison rule
  survives aggregation. The Rust fold now only prices and carries — the
  O(buckets × trades) rescan, the per-call linear close scans, and the
  dense-null bucket grid are gone. Output is SPARSE calendar buckets via
  the classic `toStartOfHour/Day/toMonday` grain (the epoch-aligned weeks
  landed on Thursdays; both arms of the endpoint now share density,
  alignment, and the in-progress-price-bucket guard).
- Three chart inputs fetched with `futures::try_join!` (were sequential).
- Chart handler: `PoolPriceContext` now carries `legs`, dropping the second
  `liquidity_pools` seek; both arms fall through one response tail.
- Activity: 3-way OR keyset → house tuple comparison; tx enrichment
  extracted to `fetch_activity_txs()` shared with the classic feed (whose
  copy had also lost the BTreeSet dedup); dead always-`None` `actor` slot
  removed; deposit arm's mut-flag loop → zip + `collect::<Option<_>>`.
- `fetch_pool_asset_ids` → `fetch_pool_feed` returning
  `enum PoolFeed { Classic, Soroban }` — the `unreachable!` in the handler
  and the garbage-surrogates-on-soroban footgun are unrepresentable now.
- `SorobanChartLeg` reuses `PriceLeg` via `enum ChartPriceId`; interval
  tables deduped.
- Wire: `application_order` is now NULLABLE on activity items — the `0`
  sentinel built dangling `#op-0` links and collided FE row keys when one
  tx emitted several events. Soroban rows link plain `/transactions/<hash>`.
- FE: `poolAmountLegs` collapsed to ONE arm for both worlds — rows
  normalize to `(leg index, signed raw amount)` and `PoolLegView` (now
  carrying `decimals`; classic = 7) supplies label/href/scale uniformly.
  `tradeRate` divides SCALED values (raw units of different-decimals legs
  were not comparable). Local `scaleRawAmount` deleted for the lib's
  validated `scaleByDecimals`. Pinned formatPoolAmount strings unchanged.
- queries.rs tests extracted to `queries_tests.rs` +
  `queries_decode_smoke.rs` (file 3,804 → 3,140 lines; per-file test
  extraction limited to PR-touched god files, per Karol).

Cross-validation (scratch harness, zero shared code with the API): activity
20/20 rows field-identical to an independent Python decode of raw
`soroban_events` (leg mapping confirmed against PROD `asset_sac` — the SHX
SAC has no local contracts row, which is exactly why the API matches legs
by surrogate); chart 1h recomputed from raw tables matches every point to
the cent; 1w bucket lands on Monday; three 400-anti-tests pass; Playwright
3/3. Rig note: Playwright needs vite started with
`VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4280` (the `.env.development.local`
default of 4200 silently starves the app) and the stub prices DB needs
`prices.price_usd_series` (prod's daily name), not `_1d`.

## Decisions 2026-08-31 (owner) — plane_id stays, chunking into the row contract, duplicate codes stay

- **27A: `plane_id` STAYS on `pool_state_changes`** — cheap provenance
  insurance: the plane contract's identity is stored nowhere else, and
  recovering "which deployment's scoreboard wrote this state" after the
  fact would take a full-history re-parse. 8 bytes/row buys that never
  being necessary. (A full removal was built and reverted the same day on
  the owner's correction — recorded so the exercise isn't repeated: the
  fields are write-only today, and the removal is mechanical if ever
  re-decided.)
- **29: `reserveRows` chunking deleted** — a new `SummaryRows` sibling in
  `SummaryRow.tsx` lays a flat cell list out two-per-row, so the pairing
  lives beside the 2-cell row contract that causes it and any future
  variable-cell caller reuses it. Rendering identical (verified on the
  3-leg demo pool: 2+1 rows).
- **32C: duplicate leg codes stay as-is** (EURC × two issuers renders two
  `EURC` labels; the asset link disambiguates). Options A (collision-only
  issuer suffix) and B (issuer domain) recorded here if it ever bites.

## Review of PR #438 closed (2026-09-01) — every finding fixed in-branch

Seven-agent review (correctness, simplify, devil, prod-readiness, security, UX,
architect) over the whole PR and its foundations, then a judge pass and an
adversarial re-verification of each P1 in code. Verdict was REQUEST CHANGES:
the architecture is better and the branch is a net reduction, but it carried a
class of merge-blockers. Owner's call was to fix everything here rather than
spawn per-finding tasks. Done.

### The root class, and how far it reached

One root: **an entity's identity taken from a payload the emitting contract
chooses freely, instead of from the authenticated owner/emitter, with no
downstream check.** A three-agent sweep graded every entity producer in
`xdr-parser` and `db-clickhouse/persist` against it.

- **Confined to the new 0374 code.** Every pre-existing producer anchors
  identity to an authenticated source — ledger-entry owner, event
  `contract_id`, tx source, or a crypto derivation corroborated against the
  emitter (`nft.rs`'s `derived_sac == emitter` is the reference).
- **One pre-existing relative, out of scope here**: `operation_asset_appearances`
  takes an asset identity from an event topic with no emitter check. Presence
  only — the value path has read authenticated ledger deltas since 0393 — and
  it already has a task. Re-verified and recorded in **0410**, which is the
  only other member of the class.
- The schema comment that licensed the RMT choice claimed orphan registrations
  "go to a monitored counter, never into rows". No such counter existed; the
  comment now describes the guard that does.

### What changed structurally

`pool_share_tokens` became **`pool_instance_state(pool_id, plane_id,
share_token_id, derived_at_ledger)`** — one table, because both facts come from
one authenticated source (the pool's own instance storage, where the pool
contract is the ledger-authenticated owner), read in one pass, on one version
clock. A second side table was considered and rejected. Free to do: nothing had
deployed. **ADR 0058 decision 4 amended.**

`plane_id` is the authority the read path checks: all three reserve reads (KPI,
chart, list activity) keep only `pool_state_changes` rows whose plane matches
what the pool declares. Symmetrically at write time, a registration becomes a
row only when the named pool declares that emitter as its `Router`.

### Decisions worth carrying

- **No version column on `pool_state_changes`** — the fold is the fix. A
  `write_order` column was built and REMOVED: it was keyed on the fold position
  within a batch, so a narrow re-parse could stamp a lower version than the
  original wide parse and lose to the stale row, inverting the guarantee
  `backfills.md` rule 4 rests on. The classic twin `liquidity_pool_snapshots`
  is version-less for exactly this reason.
- **`pool_kind = 0` stays in `asset_codes_predicate`** — it reads only the
  legacy pair columns, which only classic rows fill, so the guard states the
  function's domain rather than patching a symptom. The more fundamental fix
  (soroban rows carrying NULL instead of a placeholder `0`) would touch the
  ~612 call sites bound to that legacy shape; the guard disappears with them.
- **Search no longer invents a label.** A soroban row's label is `NULL` in SQL
  and built in Rust from the pool's resolved legs — the same identities the
  list and detail render — rather than a hardcoded string.

### Verified against sources outside our own code

- **Failed transactions cannot deliver a contract event.** Stellar's docs:
  consensus contract events are "only populated if the transaction succeeds",
  while diagnostic events "include events from failed contract calls".
  Measured on production over 500 ledgers: 2,199 failed soroban transactions
  carry **only `fee` events** (4,398 = 2 × 2,199), zero contract events. So a
  failed `add_pool` can only reach us as a diagnostic event, and filtering that
  container is what excludes it. Note the converse is NOT true — failed
  transactions do emit consensus `fee` events, correctly, since the fee applied.
- **Cardinality, measured 2026-09-01** from `add_pool` in `soroban_events`:
  10 routers, 500 pools, 500 registrations, **no pool registered twice** — so a
  pool has exactly one router, and `deployment_id` is properly a column rather
  than a join table. Heavily skewed: one router holds 343 of 500. By type:
  constant 375, stable 83, concentrated 39, elastic 3 — so **461 pools mint a
  share token and 39 structurally never do**, which is why `share_token_id = 0`
  is an answer, not a gap. 438 of 500 have ever emitted a flow event.
  (Plane count stays at 2 from earlier work — planes emit no events, so it
  cannot be measured this way until `pool_state_changes` exists on prod.)

### Found while verifying, fixed on develop

`nx typecheck` replayed a cached success while the tree had real type errors.
Not the known stale-`.tsbuildinfo` trap: the target is inferred with
`production` inputs, which EXCLUDE `*.test.ts`, while `tsc --build` typechecks
them — so it checked files its cache key did not track. Reproduced both ways
and fixed in `nx.json` (commit on develop, since it affects every project and
the pre-commit gate, not this branch).

### Still open

Production verification, in the order now written into the runbooks: DDL →
indexer → three catch-up backfills → window-closure check → only then the read
surfaces. Nothing here is verified on production yet.

## Soroban ↔ classic read-surface inconsistencies — ranked (karolkow, 2026-09-01)

Ranked by "data exists and is merely unwired" (high) vs "structural or costly"
(low). Recorded verbatim from the owner's audit; each is a fact about the
CURRENT branch, not a new commitment.

1. 🔴 **`total_shares` empty for every soroban pool.** The Summary card reads
   from `liquidity_pool_snapshots`, which soroban never writes. The value
   exists TWICE already: the chain keeps `TotalShares` in the fungible pool's
   instance storage (observed on mainnet; `PoolInstanceState` does not parse
   the key), and the participants endpoint already computes
   `sum(amount)` over the share token's holders. Same class as TVL/volume.
   Highest: visible on every soroban pool page, cheap to close — and the
   WRITE half (parse `TokenShare`-sibling `TotalShares` into the instance
   arm) belongs with the indexer, before any backfill runs.
2. 🟠 **`participant_count` KPI says "—" while the section below lists the
   participants.** Two surfaces of one page contradict each other. Cost is
   real — EXPLAIN ESTIMATE: the `asset_id` filter on `balances` reads
   120,554,700 rows (table is sorted by `holder_id`) — but the participants
   endpoint pays that scan anyway for the percentage denominator. Cheap exit:
   the participants response carries the count, the KPI reads it. Expensive:
   a second scan on detail.
3. 🟠 **Asset-code filter blind to soroban.** `asset_codes_predicate` is
   gated `pool_kind = 0` (the #438 review fix), so filtering `USDC` finds no
   soroban pool despite many carrying a USDC leg. Closure IS step 3 of 0530
   (legs migration): match through `legs` + asset dimensions, uniform for
   both kinds; the guard dies there.
4. 🟡 **`last_updated_ledger` means a different thing per kind.** Classic:
   last trade. Soroban: registration. List ORDER is fixed (activity_ledger),
   but the wire FIELD still carries two semantics under one name. Target:
   a separate `last_activity_ledger` on the wire, or one semantic.
5. 🟡 **No `#op-N` anchor on the soroban activity feed.** `op_index` exists
   in the parser but `soroban_events` does not store it, and the schema
   records why (key inexpressible for tx-level and pre-protocol-23 events).
   Closure = column + backfill. Real limitation, not an oversight.
6. 🟡 **Concentrated positions (39 pools) not rendered.** Decided ("three
   tables, not four": live aggregation over 13,801 events is cheap) but the
   render is step 23, deliberately LAST. Today those pools show the
   deliberate participants 400 and nothing else.
7. 🟢 **`share_percentage` has a different denominator per kind.** Classic
   divides by snapshot `total_shares`; soroban by the sum of positive
   balances. Both correct, but two definitions under one field name. Unify
   only after item 1.
8. 🟢 **`pool_type` / `protocol` null on classic.** Correct (a protocol pool
   has neither an AMM type nor a vendor) — the Summary card just renders two
   fewer rows. Visual asymmetry, not a data defect.

## DECIDED (karolkow, 2026-09-01) — split the PR: write path ships, read path waits

Executed the same day: write half extracted to branch
`feat/0374-aquarius-write-path` (95 files off develop, byte-identical to the
#438 states on those paths; `cargo check --workspace` + all four crates' tests
green; `extract_openapi` output JSON-identical to the committed spec, so the
api-types gate passes untouched). PR #438 and its branch stay exactly as they
are — the committed archive of the read half. Excluded deliberately: this task
file (its history lives on the #438 branch), the `POOLS_REAL` Playwright spec,
`crates/api`, `web`, `libs/api-types`. Motivation: the API + frontend in PR
#438 read a schema this task's
own follow-through (0530 legs migration, registry-normalization re-open,
snapshot unification triggers, items 1/2/4/7 above) intends to change — so the
read surface would be verified twice.

Sketch of the split (see the wayfinder map for the current state):

- **Write half → new PR**: `crates/xdr-parser`, `crates/db-clickhouse`,
  `crates/indexer`, `crates/backfill-runner`, the `audit-harness` deletion,
  ADR 0058, write-side docs. Parser-level verification (90-ledger raw corpus,
  bidirectional anti-tests) rides with it. Compiles alone — the api crate at
  develop does not reference the new tables.
- **Read half stays on this branch as the archive**: `crates/api`, `web`,
  `libs/api-types`. NOT `git stash` — the work is committed; the branch is
  the preservation. Playwright + API-battery live proof stays with it.
- **Consolidation gate must be narrow**: the read revival waits for
  wire-shape changes (items 1, 2, 4, 7 + the registry-normalization
  re-open), NOT for 0530's ~612 classic call-site migration — soroban's read
  path already sits on the target model (`legs`, `pool_kind`), so gating on
  0530 in full would hold issue #405 hostage to classic-side refactoring.
- **Concrete win**: schema changes are free while no reader exists — every
  "free change, production DDL did not exist yet" note in this file is that
  principle. The writer deploy also starts the catch-up clock earlier.

## Three-lens review of the write half + greenfield schema audit (2026-09-01)

Owner smelled the schema ("two plane_id columns") and asked for
devils-advocate + ponytail-review + /simplify over init.sql / stage.rs /
pool_router.rs / pool_state.rs, then a first-principles redesign. Results,
each verified by producer→consumer trace:

**The dual plane_id is NOT the defect** — it is claim (who wrote the reserve
row) vs authority (what the pool's own instance declares), and reads compare
one against the other; one column cannot be compared with itself. The defect
found instead:

1. **CONFIRMED, must land before prod DDL: forged plane writes can EVICT
   genuine reserve rows.** The stage fold and the table sort key are
   `(pool_id, ledger_sequence)` — blind to plane — while the plane arm
   accepts any `[PoolData, Address(pool)]` shape. A forged entry applying
   later in the same ledger evicts the genuine row at parse time; the
   read-side plane filter then hides the forgery but serves the PREVIOUS
   ledger's reserves as current. Fix is free pre-DDL: `plane_id` into the
   fold key and `ORDER BY (pool_id, plane_id, ledger_sequence)` — forged
   rows land in their own key space and die at the read filter.
2. Reads apply the pool's CURRENT plane to ALL history (argMax) and nothing
   warns when an instance write re-points a pool's plane — the share-token
   column of the same table measured 13 such re-pointings, so the "planes
   never migrate" assumption must fail loudly: add a warn.
3. The resurrected registry-backfill generator cannot corroborate routers
   (instance storage is not in soroban_events): it must refuse duplicate
   registrations and the deploy window re-runs the "no pool registered
   twice" measurement. → final-phase checklist.
4. `commit()`'s exhaustive destructure guards half the silent-drop
   invariant; `write_ledger` needs the same over `StagedLedger`.
5. init.sql's "a third party cannot register — or overwrite" overclaims
   (the UNVERIFIED router-less arm is the documented exception); one clause.

**Simplify/ponytail (converged independently, net ~−95 lines):** four
hand-copied last-wins folds → one generic `keep_last_by_key` (also gives
finding 1's key change a single home); `dedup_final_plane_writes` is
redundant with the stage fold (two independent traces); `pool_state.rs`
hand-rolls scval readers incl. a local `map_get` (the exact 0393 recurrence
— `pool_router.rs` imports them correctly); `subpool_salt` is decoded then
dropped against the schema's own "extract on demand, never copy" rule; plus
a minor batch (per-event String clone on the hot path, two reserve-parse
idioms in one function, duplicate bytes32 reader, comment triplication,
soroban-arm helper extraction).

**The fundamental alternative to the dual plane_id — measured and refuted
(2026-09-01).** Owner challenged the claim-vs-authority check as a patch and
asked whether the pool's OWN instance storage (self-authenticated: entry
owner == pool identity) could be the reserve source, dissolving the forgery
surface entirely. Measured on the 90-ledger raw corpus (all eras, all
types): every one of 239 plane writes has a same-ledger instance write
(coverage 100%); the mirror exists under three spellings (constant
`ReserveA/B`, stable `Reserves` vec, concentrated `Reserve0/1`) and NEVER
contradicts the plane (233 equal, 0 differ, 6 apparent shorts of which 5
are the concentrated prefix-vector false alarm) — **but the ELASTIC type
mirrors nothing**: its instance carries `TokenA/B`, `Oracle`,
`FeeFraction`… and no reserve key in any spelling; elastic reserves live
ONLY in the plane. So the self-authenticated source cannot be universal,
the plane machinery must stay for at least one type, and switching the
others would trade one mechanism + one check for three source arms + the
same check. Also re-measured pre-dedup collisions: 29 of 259 real
(pool, ledger) instance keys carry >1 image (max 5 in one ledger) —
`dedup_final_pool_instances` is load-bearing, not theoretical; and 0 pools
in the corpus are written by more than one distinct plane — the forged-write
class remains unobserved in the wild, and the plane-in-key fix is purely
preventive. Write-time filtering (prefetched pool→plane map) was rejected
for a fundamental reason, not a stylistic one: under a PARALLEL backfill a
pool's activity partition can stage before its registration partition
commits, so the map is incomplete and genuine rows would be refused
permanently and silently; the stored-provenance + read-filter form is
order-independent and reversible.

**Greenfield audit (from requirements R1-R8, not from the code): the
3-table shape is the fixed point.** One RMT row = one writer = one clock
forces exactly one table per (writer, clock, grain), and there are exactly
three: registration events / reserve stream / pool self-declarations.
M1 (fold instance state into the registry) fails on migration clobber and
on AggregatingMergeTree's max() keeping the WRONG token when a migration
re-points to a lower hash surrogate; M2 (fold into the time series) lets a
forger's row collide with the authority row that exists to reject him;
M4 (read-time derivation) is impossible — instance writes are ledger-entry
changes, absent from soroban_events. Zero tables to save. The audit adds
one thing: `total_shares Int128` on `pool_instance_state` (same entry, same
pass, same clock) — the write half of ranked-inconsistency item 1, belongs
in the same pre-backfill DDL.

## Correction (2026-09-02) — concentrated positions are NOT NFTs

ADR 0058 (and a code comment on the feature branch) said concentrated
positions "are NFTs". Vendor docs and this task's own step-17 decision
(2026-08-26) refute it: a position is the storage entry keyed
`(owner, tick_lower, tick_upper)` — no share token, no NFT, no numeric
position id; `position_update` is the indexing source. The phrase entered on
2026-08-29 as an unsourced aside in the read-path commit (a Uniswap-v3
pattern carried over) and was copied into the ADR the same day. ADR fixed;
the branch comment corrected in place. Indexing stays deferred to 0516.

## CONFIRMED DEFECT (2026-09-08) — soroban pool legs key on the SAC surrogate, and orphan

Found while designing the read half's `legs` migration, by tracing the
producer after the owner refused a measurement that "smelled wrong" — the
first reading blamed two disjoint id spaces, which the code refutes.

**There is ONE id space.** `ids::asset_id` returns `contract_id` for a
soroban token, so a token contract's surrogate _is_ its asset id. The classic
arm goes through `pool_leg_asset_id`, which branches on the XDR asset type
and yields the canonical id. The three soroban registry-row builders
(`pool_registry_row`, `factory_pair_registry_row`, `config_pool_registry_row`)
instead call `ids::contract_id(token)` **directly — no branch, no lookup**.

That is correct for a genuine soroban token and WRONG for a SAC. ADR 0051
retired `asset_type = 2`: a SAC is not a distinct asset and has no `assets`
row of its own, so anything keyed on its surrogate orphans. The balance path
already re-keys through `fetch_sac_classic_map`; `stage.rs` even carries the
comment naming the failure ("must key by the classic/native asset it wraps
**or it would orphan**"). The pool leg writer skips that step.

### Measured on production, 2026-09-08

| pool kind | leg occurrences | native id | classic credit id | soroban token id | **orphan** |
| --------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| classic   | 38,932          | 4,222     | 34,642            | 0                | **0**      |
| soroban   | 1,175           | 0         | 0                 | 91               | **1,084**  |

The split is clean — zero ambiguous cases: 1,059 of 1,151 leg occurrences
(measured a few minutes earlier in the same session) carry `is_sac = true`
AND appear in `asset_sac`; 92 carry neither. All 1,059 resolve to an
`assets.id` by **pure lookup** — no hashing, so the repair needs no
re-implementation of `hash64` in SQL (which would be impossible: our
surrogate is not ClickHouse's `cityHash64`). Both join directions are
unambiguous (313,037 SAC surrogates → 0 with more than one asset).

Worked example — 211 soroban pools hold a native XLM leg, and not one carries
XLM's id `-6959166271784855184`. They all carry `-6164601581949826601`, the
surrogate of XLM's SAC `CAS3J7GY…` (confirmed in `asset_sac` as asset_type 0,
issuer 0). To the database that is not XLM; it is nothing.

Raw sample, one row per variant (`legs` today → after the fix):

| variant                 | pool           | legs today             | resolves to | legs after             | resolves to |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| classic / native        | `0E544374BBD5` | `-6959166271784855184` | type 0      | unchanged              | XLM         |
| classic / credit        | `544317D9B5E7` | `4519192638202107447`  | type 1 USDZ | unchanged              | USDZ        |
| soroban / SAC of native | `0A0D06326A1B` | `-6164601581949826601` | **ORPHAN**  | `-6959166271784855184` | XLM         |
| soroban / SAC of credit | `E55B1F69F0B8` | `5690321183329937413`  | **ORPHAN**  | `1076006802138508448`  | EURC        |
| soroban / real token    | `FDD21419D7EC` | `6077758128363813942`  | type 3      | unchanged              | unchanged   |

Classic rows and genuine-soroban-token rows do not move. Only the SAC legs do.

### Consequences for the read half

- `asset → pools` breaks across kinds: the same asset carries two different
  ids depending on which kind of pool references it, so "pools holding USDC"
  cannot be one query.
- Naming: measured over the BROKEN state, 216 of 1,151 leg occurrences (18.8%)
  had no name anywhere. Over the FIXED state that collapses to **5** — 1,059
  become classic assets with real codes, and 87 of the 92 genuine soroban
  tokens carry an on-chain SEP-41 symbol.
- The `pool_kind = 0` guard the #438 review added to `asset_codes_predicate`
  is NOT the fix for this and must not be re-created (task 0530 deletes it).

### Decision (karolkow, 2026-09-08) — repair at the source, option A

Rejected: a read-time bridge through `asset_sac` (rebuilds machinery the write
side already owns, and becomes permanent). Rejected: promoting a SAC to a
first-class asset with its own `assets` row (reverses ADR 0051 and fragments
every balance — the same disease at larger scale).

Deployment order, and the reason for it: **every writer producing old-rule rows
must finish before the repair script runs**, or it re-introduces wrong rows.
The registry backfill is such a writer and is running for BOTH pool kinds.

1. Backfill finishes.
2. Deploy the corrected writer — everything new is right from that moment.
3. Repair script over `pool_kind = 1` rows only.
4. Invariant checks below.

Step 3 needs **no indexer pause**: after step 2 the live writer is already
correct, and a ClickHouse mutation only rewrites parts existing at its start.
Standing hazard to record: running a backfill with an OLD binary after step 3
re-breaks the column — step 2 must precede every later run.

### The invariant — two parts, deliberately not one

A single "every leg resolves in `assets`" check cannot pass and would have to
be weakened into uselessness. Split it:

**Hard, must be zero forever** — catches exactly this defect:

```sql
-- soroban legs whose value is a known SAC surrogate
WITH p AS (SELECT pool_id, argMax(pool_kind, last_updated_ledger) k,
                  argMax(legs, last_updated_ledger) legs
           FROM liquidity_pools GROUP BY pool_id)
SELECT count() AS mis_keyed
FROM (SELECT arrayJoin(legs) AS leg FROM p WHERE k = 1)
WHERE leg IN (SELECT sac_contract_id FROM asset_sac WHERE sac_contract_id != 0)
```

Before: **1,084**. After the repair: **0**, unconditionally.

**Soft, counted and alarmed — never silently allowed**: legs with no `assets`
row that are not a known SAC. Before: 1. After: 1. Growth means a token family
we do not know about, and we want to hear about it rather than discover it as
a blank cell.

That one is understood, not a mystery: pool
`8FE06922A146D7BEBAB9CDD93D0E34224AFE09CFB42465378423F26DA8DE3370`, registered
at ledger 50,875,676 by deployment `CARVO4GF…` — one of the five dead early
config-factory deployments that predate the documented factory. Its
registration event is the family's `["create", "liquidity_pool"]` shape, so the
legs came from the pool's own CONFIG. The pool holds exactly one
`pool_state_changes` row (its creation reserves) and emitted 2 events ever; the
leg's token contract has emitted **zero** events in our entire window. It is
not below the ingest floor (floor 50,457,424 < 50,875,676) — the token is
simply inert, so no `soroban_contracts` row was ever created for it. An
unnamed leg here is an honest statement, not a lost identity.

## Asset-identity resolution consolidated (2026-09-08) — and what it costs

The pool read path needs a leg's display identity from an `assets.id`
surrogate. Before designing one, a check of what already exists found it: task
0540 wrote `resolve_asset_identities` for the account value-flow read, with a
statement whose every shape is a paid-for lesson (LEFT join or NFT transfers
vanish; the contract leg on the same id list or the `assets` scan runs twice —
209 ms / 2.5M rows against 44 ms / 268k; `toBool` for the driver's `Bool`;
`CAST(… AS Array(Int64))` or an all-positive page 500s; `LIMIT 1 BY id` over
`FINAL`, 4.7x fewer rows). Copying that into the pools module was the wrong
answer, so the domain map's consolidation trigger — "a third consumer needing
richer fields" — fires here.

Moved to `crates/api/src/common/asset_identity.rs` with the SQL **byte-identical**
(verified programmatically, 1,137 characters). The split point moved by one
step, deliberately: the shared function now returns the RAW identity
(`ResolvedAsset`), and the account read keeps its own projection onto the three
fields a balance-change cell renders. Sharing the resolution while copying the
projection is what makes it reusable — the pool leg's projection is an avatar,
not a `CODE-ISSUER` link.

**Re-measured on production after the move** (9 mixed asset ids, one page's
worth): **605,688 rows / 6.83 MiB / 47 ms**. Against 0540's documented 44 ms /
268k the time is unchanged and the rows are 2.26x — all of it dimension growth,
accounted for exactly: `assets` 569,042 (a full scan, because `id` is not in
its `ORDER BY` and it carries no skip index) + `soroban_contract_metadata`
3,930 + 32,716 granules from the bloom seek on `soroban_contracts`.

**Worth watching, not fixing yet:** the `assets` scan is now 94% of that read
and grows with the table, and the pools path is about to become its second
caller. The fix, if it ever earns its keep, is a bloom index on `assets.id` —
the same `idx_acc_id` treatment `accounts` got at ~23M rows — which is a
production DDL and therefore an operator action. Not justified at 569k and
47 ms.

## One fact, several producers — a sweep prompted by a near-miss (2026-09-08)

While building the pool-leg display resolver I looked up the SAC mirror address
through `soroban_contracts`, and only a cost measurement (476,616 rows / ~120 ms,
the whole `asset_sac` table) revealed that `/v1/assets` does not look it up at
all — it DERIVES the address in Rust from `code:issuer`, exactly as ADR 0051
says, and reads the table only to learn whether a SAC was observed. Two ways to
produce one fact, one of them mine, caught by accident.

The owner asked for a sweep. Ranked by whether a user can see it and whether it
dies on its own.

### F1 — "what is this asset called" has THREE frontend implementations, and

three different answers

| function           | surface             | answer when the asset has no code |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `assetDisplayCode` | assets list         | `null` → renders a dash           |
| `assetLabel`       | balance-change cell | the string `Unnamed token`        |
| `assetLegLabel`    | pool leg            | **throws**                        |

One question, three surfaces, three behaviours — one of which takes the page
down. The ranked-inconsistency item about an unnamed soroban leg was about to
add a FOURTH (a truncated address) by fixing only the third.

**Fix belongs to the leg-rendering step**, which touches this code anyway: ONE
function, one ladder — native → `XLM`, code → code, on-chain symbol → symbol,
otherwise the truncated `C…` address. Measured justification for the last rung:
a soroban token's symbol is self-declared and not unique (2,276 contracts call
themselves `SMOL`, 488 `POOL`, 44 `sUSDC`; among our own pool legs three
different contracts claim `USDC`), so the address is the only identity that
discriminates — which is also why stellar.expert prints it beside the symbol
even when the symbol exists.

### F2 — the "native displays as XLM" SQL expression is written FOUR times

`search/queries.rs:717` and `assets/queries.rs:672` are byte-identical `SHOWN`
constants; `common/pool_asset_codes.rs:40` is a parameterised third; and
`search/queries.rs:322-323` inlines a fourth for the pool-pair label.

The comment guarding it says **"Change one, change all three"** — and there are
four. The comment that exists to prevent drift has drifted, which is the whole
argument in one line.

Two of the four read the legacy pair columns and **die with the legs
migration**; the surviving pair are identical constants and can become one.

### F3 — "classic precision is 7 decimals" is written FOUR times

Twice in SQL (`common/asset_identity.rs`, `accounts/queries.rs` — both
`coalesce(m.decimals, 7)`) and twice in Rust (`assets/queries.rs:565`
`unwrap_or(7)`, `assets/handlers.rs:545`). A SQL-vs-Rust divergence is harder to
notice than two Rust copies, and no test spans both.

### F4 — the composite link identity `CODE-ISSUER` is built in THREE places

`assets/handlers.rs:59` (`canonical_id`), `accounts/balance_changes.rs:353`, and
again in the frontend (`web/src/pages/pool-shared/helpers.ts`). The API composes
it twice independently; the browser composes it a third time.

### F5 — CLOSED, fixed the same day

The SAC mirror address now has one producer: `common::asset_identity::sac_strkey`
derives it and gates on the observation, and `/v1/assets` was routed through it
rather than keeping its own call. One round trip removed from the pool path.

### What is being done, and what is only recorded

| finding | action                                                                         | where               |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| F1      | fix — one naming function with one ladder                                      | leg-render step     |
| F2      | two copies die with the legs migration; fold the other two                     | legs-predicate step |
| F3      | recorded only — scattered across SQL and Rust, one constant cannot span both   |                     |
| F4      | recorded only — one API helper is cheap, the frontend copy is its own question |                     |
| F5      | done                                                                           | —                   |

No task filed. `0535` covers "the app carries two definitions of one" for link
affordance, not for asset naming, and F1 belongs to this task's own leg-render
step rather than beside it.

### Second pass on the same sweep — F6, F7, and one observation of a different kind

### F6 — "is this asset native?" is asked FIVE ways, two of them in one file

| test                                           | where                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `leg.asset_type === 0`                         | `pool-shared/helpers.ts:33` (`legHref`)                 |
| `leg.asset_type_name === 'native'`             | `pool-shared/helpers.ts:53` (`assetLegLabel`)           |
| `isNativeAssetString(value)`                   | `identifiers/native.ts`, for the operation string shape |
| `sac.asset_code == null && sac.issuer == null` | `contracts/sacAsset.ts` (`isNativeSac`)                 |
| `asset_type = 0`                               | the SQL side, ~10 sites                                 |

The first two act on the SAME object, two functions apart in the SAME file, and
test different fields for the same thing.

Each one is locally justified — native genuinely arrives in different wire
shapes (a row, an operation string, a both-null SAC facet), and
`identifiers/native.ts` says so explicitly: "an adapter over the same constant
rather than one function for both shapes". The gap is that nothing enumerates
the shapes, so a new surface adopts whichever spelling it meets first.

**Why this stops being cosmetic at the legs migration:** the wire `asset_type`
is the XDR type, and a Soroban token has no honest XDR type at all (measured:
recoverable for classic from family + code length, undefined for family 3). The
moment a leg can be a Soroban token, the number test and the name test answer
differently on the same leg. F1's single naming ladder should carry the single
native predicate with it.

### F7 — the file that calls itself "the single truncation standard" has two

hand-rolled copies

`libs/ui/src/identifiers/truncate.ts` declares "The single truncation standard:
first 4 + last 4" and exports `truncateMiddle`. `ExecutionTrace.tsx` builds
`${x.slice(0, 4)}…${x.slice(-4)}` inline, twice (lines 267 and 289). Identical
output today; a change to the standard would silently leave those two behind.
Cheap to fix, no behaviour change, and it is not this task's code — recorded, not
grabbed.

### Observation, different class — three ways to collapse a ReplacingMergeTree

`FINAL` at ~107 sites, `LIMIT 1 BY` at ~55, `argMax(…, version)` at ~44.

These are NOT interchangeable — they answer different questions (whole-row
collapse / any version when the projected columns are immutable / the newest
version), and each site reasons about its choice in a comment. So this is not a
duplicated fact and does not belong with F1-F7. It is recorded because the
choice is measurable and the measurements are one-sided: `FINAL` cost 4.7x the
rows on the asset dimensions and 19x in the case task 0420 recorded. There is no
one place stating which idiom a new read should reach for first.

### Third pass — pagination, formatting, and list-vs-detail (2026-09-08)

Three areas swept on the owner's ask. Two came back clean; the third produced
the sharpest finding of the whole sweep.

**Pagination — clean, and worth saying so.** All seven paginating modules
(accounts, assets, contracts, ledgers, liquidity_pools, nfts, transactions) go
through the one `common::cursor::encode`/`decode` and the shared
`keyset_sql` / `keyset_sql_desc`; search does not paginate. Each endpoint
defines its own cursor PAYLOAD, which is correct — different keysets carry
different fields — and no endpoint hand-rolls the comparison. Nothing to fix.

**Formatting — nearly clean.** `format/numbers.ts` calls itself the "canonical
replacement for scattered inline `n.toLocaleString('en-US')`" and the migration
is 24 call sites done, ONE straggler left (`humanizeOp.ts:444`). Chart-axis
formatters are purpose-built, not copies. The one placement smell:
`formatAbsoluteUtc` is shared by three pages but lives inside
`web/src/pages/transactions/`, so the pool page imports it as
`../transactions/formatters.js` — the same argument `identifiers/native.ts`
makes for itself ("a constant defined up in `web/src/pages` can never be
imported by this package") applies here and was not applied.

### F8 — the list and the detail compute the same three pool facts two ways

| fact                     | detail query                                      | list query                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `created_at_ledger`      | scalar subquery `min(ledger_sequence)`            | `cr` CTE, `GROUP BY pool_id`                   |
| `participant_count`      | scalar subquery `count() FROM lp_positions FINAL` | `pc` CTE, `GROUP BY pool_id`                   |
| latest snapshot reserves | whole row `WHERE sequence = (SELECT max(...))`    | `argMax(reserve_a, …)`, `argMax(reserve_b, …)` |

The third pair is the one to watch: picking the whole row at `max(ledger)` and
taking a per-column `argMax` are equivalent ONLY while `liquidity_pool_snapshots`
holds one logical row per (pool, ledger) — the 0356 invariant. They are two
formulations of one fact, each safe by a DIFFERENT assumption, and neither
states that it depends on the other's.

### F9 — the freshness window is defined twice, in two units, and they disagree

by ~19 hours today

| side     | definition                                           | in days at the measured cadence |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| API      | `FRESHNESS_WINDOW_LEDGERS = 7 * 17_280` ledgers      | **7.81**                        |
| frontend | `SEVEN_DAYS_MS = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000` wall clock | **7.00**                        |

Measured on production 2026-09-08: **15,471 ledgers closed in 24 hours = 5.58 s
per ledger**, not the 5.00 the constant assumes. So 120,960 ledgers is 7.81 days,
not 7.

**264 pools sit inside that gap right now** (22,262 fresh by both definitions,
231 stale by both). For those the API still treats the snapshot as fresh — it is
what the participants read divides `share_percentage` by — while the KPI strip
captions "no recent snapshot".

The defect is not the approximation itself. The Rust side declares it openly:
"the window is approximated by a `ledger_sequence` floor relative to chain head.
Exact wall-clock parity is a documented tolerance." The frontend then says its
own constant "**matches** the freshness window enforced by" the backend. One
side calls it an accepted tolerance, the other calls it equality, and nothing
reconciles them — which is how a tolerance quietly becomes a contradiction
between two halves of one page.

Cheapest honest fix, when this is worked: the API states freshness on the wire
(a boolean, or the cutoff it used) instead of the frontend re-deriving it in a
different unit. Same shape as ranked-inconsistency item 2, where the KPI and the
section below it disagree because each computes its own answer.

**F9 stays recorded here — searched, no task covers it.** Every open task
mentioning "stale" or "freshness" was checked by title and content; the closest
match, `0215` (LP analytics FE impact), is blocked and does not mention the
window at all. Worth linking rather than duplicating: backlog task `0510` is the
SAME SHAPE for a different fact — "the auth path is absent from the API schema,
so the frontend hand-mirrors its type". F9 is that pattern applied to freshness:
the API does not state it, so the frontend re-derives it in another unit. If
either is ever generalised, they are one problem.

## Group B shipped — the pools read path moves onto `legs` (2026-09-09)

One change, front to back: the pool endpoints, the search row and the whole
frontend stop reading `asset_a` / `asset_b` and read the `legs` array instead.

**What the shape change bought, in deletions:** three CTEs and six joins out of
the list and detail SQL, ~45 lines of positional-filter validation, the fourth
copy of "an empty code renders as XLM", a local `asset_type_name` match, and the
API's last import of the write-side surrogate helper outside one test. The read
path no longer recomputes anything the writer already computed.

**Measured on production while building it:**

|                                     |                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| pair predicate `XLM/USDC`           | 142 pools, 1,218,694 read_rows, 87 ms          |
| single needle, same shape           | ~84 ms — CH deduplicates the repeated subquery |
| classic `legs` coverage             | 37.7% → **79.8%** (backfill still running)     |
| soroban legs needing the SAC re-key | 1,084 → **1,342**                              |

### Decisions that landed inside it

**Positional filters removed, not migrated.** `filter[asset_a_code]` and its
three siblings named a leg by its position in a pair. A list of two to four legs
has no equivalent, and no client held a key to this API — the frontend's only
pool filter is the free-text box. `filter[pool_kind]` replaces them on the axis
that a pool list can actually distinguish, and rejects an unknown value with 400
rather than answering with a page that contradicts the request.

**The pair filter became a distinctness condition.** `USDC/USDC` must mean "two
USDC legs", not "USDC appears somewhere". Over two columns that was free; over a
list it is Hall's condition for two sets — each needle matches something, and at
least TWO legs match either. The extra clause costs nothing measurable.

**`reserve_a` / `reserve_b` stay pair-shaped.** The snapshot table is. A three-
or four-leg pool lists its later legs with no amount rather than dropping them,
so the composition still reads in full. Moving reserves onto legs is group C.

### F10 — one field carried two meanings

`contract_id` on a pool leg meant "the token's own contract" for a soroban leg
and "the SAC mirror" for a classic one. Those route differently: the first is a
live asset page, the second 404s (the assets endpoint pins a contract lookup to
the soroban family). Split into `contract_id` and `sac_contract_id`, and the SAC
address is now DERIVED at the response boundary from `(code, issuer, network)`
rather than looked up — ADR 0051 says a SAC is a facet, not a row.

### F11 — the same fact published twice, as a number and as a name

The leg carried both `asset_type` and `asset_type_name`, where the name is a
pure function of the number. Only the name is published now. The alphanum4 /
alphanum12 width the number distinguished is rendered nowhere in the app and is
recoverable from the code's length; for a soroban token the number had no honest
value at all, since XDR has no slot for one and its `3` already means
`pool_share`.

### F12 — one field name, two vocabularies

`asset_type_name` spoke the XDR `AssetType` domain on the pool endpoints
(`credit_alphanum4`, `pool_share`) and the asset-FAMILY domain on `/v1/assets`
(`classic_credit`, `soroban`). They coincided on the single word `native`, which
is exactly why nobody noticed. Both now speak the family vocabulary, produced by
`domain::AssetFamily::as_str` rather than a local match, so there is no copy to
drift. This is the rule task 0496 paid for in production: a renderer may only
use the vocabulary of the enum its value came from.

### F13 — F1 + F6 closed: one ladder names every asset

Three functions named an asset (`assetDisplayCode`, `assetLegLabel`, and a local
`assetLabel` in the balance-change cell), each with its own "is this native"
test and three different answers for "nothing names this": `null`, a thrown
error, and the words "Unnamed token". They are now one ladder in
`assets/assetType.ts` with two thin adapters.

The ladder gained a rung it needed anyway: **a nameless token is named by its
contract address**, truncated with the app-wide standard. A soroban token can
publish no SEP-41 symbol, and `assetLegLabel` used to THROW for any leg without
a classic code — which would have taken down the whole pools list the moment
soroban pools appeared in it. The throw survives, but only for a leg that
nothing identifies at all, which is schema drift rather than a nameless token.

### A pool with no legs says so

While the backfill runs, ~20% of classic pools still carry `legs = []`. That
rendered as a blank name and an empty reserves cell — a pool that appears to
hold nothing, which is a plausible-looking wrong answer. It now reads
"Composition not indexed", and the reserves cell falls back to the same em-dash
a stale pool shows.

### Verification

318 API tests (0 warnings), including 25 ClickHouse-gated decode smokes against
a real server; 374 web tests; typecheck and lint clean. `api-types` regenerated.
New coverage pins the three cases the pair shape could not express: a three-leg
pool renders all three, a code-less soroban leg renders its truncated address,
and the kind chip reaches `filter[pool_kind]` with the spelling the API parses.

**Not done in this pass:** a live visual check against production data. The Rust
and TS suites cover the rendering rules, but nobody has yet SEEN a soroban pool
in the UI.

### Pre-existing drift found, deliberately not fixed here

The canonical SQL docs `18` / `19` had already drifted from the live queries in
ways unrelated to this change — they still show `LEFT JOIN ledgers` whole, a
`FINAL` on the snapshot subquery, an `ON 1=1` join the code comments record as
having 500'd, and no `participant_count`. Only the leg-shaped parts were
corrected. The rest belongs to the docs-drift backlog, not to this task.

### UX pass on the visible surfaces (2026-09-09)

Measured the populations first, which reordered the fixes:

|                                   | pools                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| classic, legs indexed             | 42,422                         |
| **classic, legs NOT indexed yet** | **10,437** (19.7%)             |
| soroban (all indexed)             | 717                            |
| more than two legs                | **11** (nine 3-leg, two 4-leg) |

**Fixed — a pool with no indexed legs (10,437 rows today).** It rendered a
blank name, no avatar, and an empty reserves cell: a pool that appears to hold
nothing, which is worse than an error because it looks like an answer. Now:
"Composition not indexed" in secondary colour (so it reads as an absence, not
as a pool by that name), a `?` placeholder avatar so the column keeps its left
anchor, and the reserves cell falls back to the em-dash a stale pool shows.

**Fixed — nothing on a row said which kind a pool was.** 717 Soroban pools are
now in a list where every other column looks identical, and the new filter can
select between them. Each row carries a kind badge, reusing the assets list's
chip and its colours — `soroban` keeps the emerald it already wears there, so
one word means one colour across the app. `POOL_KIND_FILTERS` and
`poolKindMeta` live together in `liquidity-pools/poolKind.ts`, shaped after
`assets/assetType.ts`.

**Fixed — the pool name was hard-clipped, not ellipsised.** The table cell owns
`overflow: hidden` + `textOverflow: ellipsis`, but the name is a flex child
inside it and does not inherit one. Two legs never reached the edge; a pool
named by truncated contract addresses does. `noWrap` on the Typography.

**Fixed — the KPI strip had no cap.** It was exactly four cells and is now two
plus one per leg, so a four-leg pool puts six across one row. It wraps now,
rather than compressing labels past reading.

**Deliberately NOT fixed — the list row grows for a 3- or 4-leg pool.**
`height: rowHeight` is a floor on a `<tr>`, so those rows run ~6-20px taller
than their neighbours and the zebra rhythm goes slightly ragged. It affects
**11 rows out of 43,139**. Capping the reserves column at two with a "+N more"
affordance would cost more code and one more thing to explain than the raggedness
costs. Revisit if multi-leg pools stop being a rounding error.

### `/simplify` pass on the branch (2026-09-10)

Four review angles (reuse, simplification, efficiency, altitude) over the branch
diff plus the working tree. Every finding was verified against source before it
was acted on. **19 fixed, 4 skipped.**

**Two defects I had introduced by inserting code in the wrong place.** A new
function landed BETWEEN an existing doc comment and the function it documents —
twice. In `stage.rs` the Soroswap paragraph (its compiled-in 30 bps, its leg
ordering) became the opening of a generic surrogate helper shared by all three
protocol families, and the builder those facts describe was left undocumented.
Same shape in `queries.rs`. Nothing catches this: it compiles, and rustdoc
renders the lie.

**One comment that promised a guarantee its code did not provide.** The list
gated TVL on an exactly-two-leg pool with a slice pattern; the detail and chart
paths read `legs[0]` and `legs[1]` under a comment saying they did NOT price the
first two legs of a longer pool. Latent only because no soroban pool has
snapshots yet — the day one does, the list correctly refuses to price a 3-leg
pool and the detail page quietly understates it. The rule is now a property of
`PoolPriceContext` (`priced_pair`), which is where it was documented all along.

**One user-visible contradiction, live today.** The activity endpoint answered
"liquidity pool not found" for any pool with fewer than two indexed legs — 10,437
pools right now — while the detail page rendered that same pool one call earlier.
It returns an empty page instead. Existence is what the query answers; leg
completeness is a different question.

**One test that could no longer fail.** A guard scanned `liquidity_pools/queries.rs`
for a re-added `asset_a_code != ''`. This branch deleted every statement in that
file that reads those columns, so the count is now structurally zero while
reading as coverage. Its subject moved to `common::asset_identity`; the guard
moved with it, plus two unit tests on the projection.

**Round trips the branch had added.** The pools list went from 3 serialized
ClickHouse round trips to 5. The issuer seek and the SAC/enrichment reads both
hang off the identity statement and neither depends on the other, so one of the
two was pure waiting — they now overlap. Separately, global search's pool arm
paid a full `accounts` seek whose result it never reads (it NAMES legs; it never
renders a `CODE-ISSUER` link), and search fans its buckets out concurrently, so
the slowest bucket sets the response time. Both call sites now ask for what they
use.

**Duplication folded:** the "native displays as XLM" SQL had three producers
again (assets list, search, pools filter) — one now; the SAC re-key had two (the
balance path inline, the pool path copied) — one now, renamed
`contract_token_asset_id` since both callers use it; the filter-chip row had
three verbatim copies (assets, contracts, pools) — one `FilterChipRow`; the
"unreadable pool kind" fallback was guessed identically in two modules — one
`pool_identifier`. Dead code from my own refactor went with them.

#### Skipped, deliberately

**The Rust `leg_label` is a second naming ladder.** Global search composes a
pool's label server-side while the frontend has the ladder this task just
consolidated, and the two already disagree on the bottom rung (`unknown` vs
"Composition not indexed"). The honest fixes are "search returns legs and the
frontend names them" or "the API owns the label and every pool endpoint
publishes it" — both change the wire contract and ripple into the search page.
Not a cleanup.

**The pools filter matches codes but not symbols.** A soroban leg the list now
DISPLAYS as `KALE` (from its SEP-41 symbol) cannot be found by typing `KALE`,
because the needle set reads `assets.asset_code` only. Widening it is a
behaviour change and deserves its own measurement of what it costs the scan.

**Two unmeasured ClickHouse micro-optimisations** (adding `asset_type` to the
display bounds; trimming joins the chart path does not read) — plausible, worth
nothing without a measurement.

## The pair columns are gone from the code (2026-09-09)

Decision (karolkow): delete the legacy pair-column code NOW, deploy after the
backfill — the same pattern the read half followed. Removed from the row struct,
the schema, the classic writer, the three registry builders, the column-order
guard and every fixture; `crates/domain/src/pool.rs` (three Postgres-era structs,
zero consumers workspace-wide) went with them.

A classic pool's two legs still come from the XDR pair, which is where that shape
legitimately lives — it is now an input to `ids::pool_leg_asset_id` and nothing
else. The columns stopped being read by anything.

### Why the DROP is gated, and why waiting does not clear the gate

`legs` is filled at WRITE time only. `liquidity_pools` is a ReplacingMergeTree —
one row per pool, replaced when the pool is touched — so a pool gets legs when
the indexer next writes it, and a pool that stopped trading is never written
again. The deploy moment is visible in the data as a clean cut:

| `last_updated_ledger` band | with legs | without |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------- |
| 63.0–63.8 M                | **0**     | 4 738   |
| 64.0 M                     | 1 288     | 1 389   |
| 64.2 M+                    | 23 297    | **0**   |

Zero legged rows below the cut, zero legless above it. That is the signature of
rewrite-on-touch, not of anything walking the table.

The residue is entirely dormant — measured 2026-09-09, of 10 276 unmigrated
classic pools:

| last touched    | pools |
| --------------- | ----- |

A ledger-range re-index cannot reach a pool that did not trade in that range, so
the residue does not shrink on its own in any useful way.

**The drop is irreversible.** A row with empty `legs` carries its composition
nowhere else, and the leg surrogate is `cityhash_102_128`'s low half, which
ClickHouse cannot compute (`cityHash64` is a different algorithm) — so the
identity is not recoverable from the database at all, only by re-parsing XDR
from S3. `docs/deployment.md` now carries the DDL inside the existing 0374
pause window, with the gate above it: `countIf(length(legs) = 0)` MUST be 0, and
if it is not, the one-shot table pass runs first (it reads the very columns being
dropped, so that order is not negotiable).

## Soroban total shares wired up (2026-09-09) — ranking item 1

The audit ranked this 🔴 highest and assumed it needed a write-half change
("parse TotalShares into the instance arm"). Measured: that half already runs.
`pool_instance_state` carries `total_shares` on production, and the API had
never read that table at all — 550 of 736 soroban pools gain a real number
where the page shows an em-dash today.

Two things the wiring had to get right, neither visible from the field name:

**Scale.** The snapshot column is `Decimal128(7)` and arrives pre-scaled; the
instance column is a RAW `Int128` straight out of contract storage, to be scaled
by the SHARE TOKEN's own decimals. Measured across production: every share token
in the set reports 7 — but the value is read rather than assumed, because a
silent mismatch renders a number off by orders of magnitude and nothing fails.
The scaling is string surgery, not arithmetic: an `f64` drops digits above 2^53
and this number is the denominator every participant's share percentage is
quoted against.

**Zero is not zero.** The schema records `total_shares = 0` as "key absent" —
structural for the concentrated and elastic families, permanent for the
config-factory one. It renders as the same em-dash a stale pool shows. A
rendered `0` would state that a pool holding real liquidity has no shares.

The fallback rule lives in one function used by both the list and the detail,
and the joined subquery has one producer, so this does not become the fourth
copy of a pool fact computed two ways (the F8 shape).

The ClickHouse-gated smokes earned their keep again: the first version projected
a non-nullable `String` through a LEFT JOIN, and with `join_use_nulls = 0` an
unmatched row yields `''` rather than NULL, which the driver refuses to decode
into an `Option`. Four smokes failed instantly; no unit test would have seen it.

## Run against production (2026-09-09) — three defects the test suite could not see

Stood the API up against production ClickHouse and drove the SPA. Every one of
these passed 327 Rust tests, 376 web tests and 24 ClickHouse-gated smokes first.

**1. The pools list 500'd on the default page.** `asset_enrichment.icon_url` is
`Nullable(String)`, so `argMax` over it is nullable too, and the row struct
declared a bare `String` — the driver refuses that (the 0324 class). Every other
reader of this column already declares it optional; this one had diverged. The
smokes missed it because they decode nothing when no leg matches an enrichment
row, and the soroban-filtered page missed it because its legs resolve to nothing
at all. Only a page with real classic assets triggers it.

**2. The detail route 404'd every soroban pool the list linked to.** The path
validator still demanded an `L…` prefix. The encoder was made kind-aware and the
free-text parser was taught both forms; this third gate was missed. Now accepts
`L…` or `C…`, which is what the identifier actually is.

**3. The frontend had its OWN copy of that gate**, and it short-circuited to
"not found" before the request was ever made — so fixing the API alone changed
nothing on screen. `isPoolId` stays narrow on purpose (search uses it to tell a
pool from a contract; widening it would route every contract to the pool page),
so the rule is a separate `isPoolIdentifier`. Two gates, two languages, one
rule — the shape this task keeps finding.

### What the screen actually shows

Working: the kind chip row and the per-row kind badge; `C…` pool identifiers;
**a three-leg pool rendering three avatars and `A / B / C`** — the shape the pair
could never express; total shares live, both in the KPI strip (`7.1`) and the
summary (`7.0710678`), which is the item-1 wiring confirmed end to end.

Not working, and NOT a code defect: **every leg renders as a truncated `C…`
address instead of a code.** Measured over the 303 distinct soroban legs — 40
resolve to a full identity, 262 resolve only to a contract address, 1 to
nothing. The pool screenshotted holds native XLM as its first leg and shows
`CAS3…OWMA`, because that leg is keyed on the XLM SAC contract surrogate rather
than the native asset id. This is exactly the defect
`docs/runbooks/0374_lp_legs_sac_rekey_repair.md` exists to repair, and that
repair has not run.

**Deploy consequence:** the SAC re-key repair must ship WITH this, not after it.
Otherwise 739 soroban pools become visible and unreadable on the same day.

### Coverage at the time of the run

|                                        |                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `legs`, classic                        | 83.3% (44,051 / 52,876) — rising, 79.8% the day before |
| `legs`, soroban                        | 100% (739 / 739)                                       |
| soroban legs resolving to an asset row | **6.6%**                                               |
| soroban total shares showing a number  | 75% (554 / 739)                                        |

One display nit, pre-existing: a pool holding `0.01` shares renders as `0`
because `formatCompactAmount` rounds it. Not introduced here and not the
compact formatter's bug to fix in this task.

## The legs-fill pass was wrong, and is gone (2026-09-09)

Karol: _"czekaj po co ten skrypt pool legs fills, smierdzi mi to"_. Correct on
both counts.

**The premise was false.** The reasoning was: our leg surrogate is a
`cityhash_102_128` low half, ClickHouse's builtin hash is a different algorithm,
**therefore** it must be computed in Rust. The first half is true and the second
does not follow — because for a classic pool the leg surrogate IS the `assets.id`
of that asset. Same formula, same inputs: native is `hash64("native")` on both
sides, credit is `hash64("code:issuer")` on both. The hash was computed once
already, when the `assets` row was written. The value does not need computing,
it needs **looking up** — and SQL does that.

Measured on production against pools that already have legs: a plain join
reproduces **44,106 of 44,108**, and so does the `Map` form the mutation
actually uses. The two misses are pools whose asset has no `assets` row at all.

**It also duplicated a mechanism already in the tree.** The SAC repair is
`ALTER TABLE liquidity_pools UPDATE legs = … WHERE pool_kind = 1`. The pass was
a second operation on the same column of the same table, scoped to
`pool_kind = 0`, in the same deploy window — using a heavier mechanism
(whole-table rebuild + `EXCHANGE`) that, unlike the mutation, requires the
indexer stopped. A heavier tool doing half the job the lighter one was already
doing.

Deleted: the module, its subcommand and its `backfills.md` section. The runbook
now carries both repairs — **A** (soroban re-key) and **B** (classic fill) —
one mechanism, two scopes, one window. B guards itself: a map miss maps to `-1`
and the `WHERE` skips that row, so a pool whose asset is unknown keeps its empty
`legs` and stays visible to the gate rather than being written a `0` that would
read as an answer.

**What I should have asked before writing it:** does anything already touch this
column, and is the value derivable rather than computable. Both answers were in
the tree.

## Every gap on a Soroban pool page, measured (2026-09-09)

Karol drove the local build and listed what was missing. Each one traced. The
headline: **almost none of it is missing data — it is one table the read path
never opens.**

`pool_state_changes` carries `reserves Array(Int128)` per ledger — a per-leg
time series in exactly the shape a two-to-four-leg pool needs — for **734 of
739** soroban pools. `crates/api` does not reference that table anywhere.

| gap on the page                            | data exists?                         | where                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| per-leg reserves `—`                       | YES, 734/739 (616 non-zero)          | `pool_state_changes.reserves`                   |
| TVL `—`                                    | derivable                            | those reserves × the price lookup already built |
| TVL / volume chart "no activity"           | YES                                  | `pool_state_changes` IS the soroban time series |
| "Recent activity" empty                    | YES, 3.4M rows over 752 pools        | `pool_state_changes`                            |
| Participants `0`                           | YES, 575 of 705 pools, 4,178 holders | `balances` keyed on `share_token_id`            |
| legs render as `C…` addresses              | NO — needs the repair                | runbook A                                       |
| `filter[asset_code]` finds no soroban pool | NO — same cause                      | runbook A                                       |

The reserve arrays line up with the leg counts: 723 of 728 two-leg pools, 9 of
9 three-leg, 2 of 2 four-leg. The shape was built for this and nothing reads it.

**`lp_positions` is classic-only** — 0 of 739 soroban pools have a row, by
construction: it tracks trustline LP shares. A soroban pool's providers are
holders of its share TOKEN, which is why the count has to come from `balances`.
This is ranking item 2, and the measurement says the cheap exit it describes is
real.

### The asset filter is not broken, it is blocked

`USDC` + soroban returns **0 today and 161 with the SAC re-key applied**
(simulated read-only against production). Nothing to fix in the predicate.

### The default order shows the worst of the population

The list is `ORDER BY last_updated_ledger DESC`, and that column means _last
trade_ for a classic pool but _registration_ for a soroban one (ranking item 4).
So the soroban list opens on the most recently REGISTERED pools — the ones with
nothing in them yet:

|                          | pools with shares   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| whole soroban population | 553 / 739 = **75%** |
| **first page (20)**      | 7 / 20 = **35%**    |

The emptiness Karol saw is real but unrepresentative, and it is the sort key
doing it. Fixing item 4 (a `last_activity_ledger` with ONE meaning) also fixes
what the first page shows. Ordering by a value — TVL, or shares — is the other
option and is worth deciding deliberately rather than inheriting.

### Fixed here

The detail page carried no kind badge while every list row did — the one page
about a single pool was the only place that would not say which kind it was.

## Why the coverages are low, and the sort key (2026-09-09)

Karol, on being shown sort-key coverage: _"czemu takie małe pokrycia tych
niektórych??"_ — worth asking, because two of the three are facts about the
population and one is a known defect.

**Reserves / shares, 76%.** Not a gap. **Every** classic pool has a snapshot;
23.6% of them (12,485) have a snapshot saying **zero shares** — pools everyone
withdrew from, last moved 401 days ago on average. Sorting by shares would rank
live pools above dead ones, which is arguably the point.

**Participants, 50%.** Partly the dead pools, but 14,158 pools (26.8%) have
shares and NO known holder — impossible on chain, so ours. Already root-caused
in this task's own K4-6 record: the ingest floor. A pool-share trustline created
before L50,458,12x never produced a row, because we only ever saw trustlines
that changed after the floor. Off this branch by decision (2026-08-29).

**TVL, 34%.** A market fact. Only **3,444 of 19,503** distinct classic legs have
a USD price in the last 48h (17.7%), and only 5,253 assets have a price at all.
Pool coverage is higher than leg coverage because pools concentrate on the few
priced assets.

### The sort key: measured, then decided

| candidate             | coverage | usable as a key?       |
| --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| `last_updated_ledger` | 100%     | yes — but two meanings |
| unified last activity | 99.99%   | **yes**                |
| shares / reserves     | 76%      | no                     |
| participants          | 50%      | no                     |
| TVL                   | 34%      | no                     |

The coverage table is not the binding constraint — **keyset pagination is**.
The list pages on `(sort key, pool_id)`, so the key must be computable in the
`WHERE` of the paging CTE. TVL, participants and shares are all computed at
read, per page (TVL deliberately so, ADR 0053), and none of them can be a
paging key without being materialised onto the row first. That rules them out
regardless of coverage.

**Chosen: `greatest(last_updated_ledger, max(pool_state_changes.ledger_sequence))`.**
No schema change, no writer change, no backfill — measured at 3.5M read_rows /
60 ms, against the 9.7M / 264 ms the list query already spends. `greatest`
avoids a `pool_kind` branch: a classic pool has no state-change rows so its
column wins, and a soroban pool's activity is never earlier than its
registration.

Result on production: the first soroban page went from **7 of 20** pools
carrying shares to **13 of 20**, against 75% across the population. It now opens
on pools holding 120,934 and 121,948 shares instead of ones registered minutes
ago and empty.

### The bug that only two pages could show

The first version paged correctly and returned garbage: 50 rows fetched, 30
unique. The paging CTE ordered by the new expression while the OUTER query still
ordered by `last_updated_ledger`, so the page held the right rows in the wrong
order and `finalize_page` cut the cursor from the wrong last row. One page looks
perfect; it takes two to see it. Now pinned by a ClickHouse-gated smoke that
fetches a real second page and asserts it repeats nothing.

## `pool_state_changes` connected — reserves live on the leg (2026-09-09)

The table was already carrying `reserves Array(Int128)` per ledger for 734 of
739 soroban pools, and the read path had never opened it. It does now, and the
reserve moved from a `reserve_a` / `reserve_b` pair onto the LEG.

That is the only shape that holds both sources. A classic pool's reserves come
from its snapshot, already scaled by the column's `Decimal128(7)`; a soroban
pool's come from the state changes as RAW integers, to be scaled by each leg's
own decimals — which the identity resolver already returns. One `reserve` field
per leg, both normalised to a decimal string, so no reader has to know which
source answered. A pair could never have held the third.

It cost no extra scan: `pool_state_changes` was already being aggregated for
the ordering key, so the reserves ride along as one more column on the same
`GROUP BY`.

Verified on production: the three-leg pool now shows **259.3614804 /
1,464.3416903 / 16.1945684**, and 40 of 40 legs on the soroban list page carry
an amount where every one read `—` before.

**And the caption was lying.** The KPI strip keyed "no recent snapshot" off
snapshot freshness, so every soroban pool claimed staleness while displaying a
current reserve — and hid the asset link while doing it. The caption now follows
the VALUE: present means no stale caption, absent distinguishes "no recent
snapshot" from "not indexed".

### A regression this found on the way, and its fix

Ordering by activity surfaced the BUSIEST pools, and the list derived
`created_at_ledger` as `min(ledger_sequence)` over each page pool's entire
snapshot history — unbounded. The same subquery cost 7.1M rows / 43 ms under the
old ordering and **35.1M rows / 406 ms** under the new one, which was the whole
cost of the request.

Nothing renders that field. It is now **detail-only**, like `volume` and
`fee_revenue` already are in the same DTO — pinned to one pool it is a cheap
seek. The list went 35.1M / 1.27 GiB / 406 ms → **25.4M / 978 MiB / 330 ms**.

The band also had to follow: it read `min/max(last_updated_ledger)` while the
page had moved to `activity_ledger`. On a soroban-filtered page those diverge by
years, and the band stretched to 11.4M ledgers — 66.7M rows and 2.95 GiB against
a 4 GB profile, to find snapshots soroban pools do not have.

Remaining list cost is ~25M rows, against ~9.7M before this branch. The
difference is the `pool_state_changes` aggregate plus the busier pools the new
order surfaces. Worth revisiting, not worth blocking on.

## Participants counted for Soroban pools — ranking item 2 (2026-09-09)

A classic pool's providers hold pool-share TRUSTLINES (`lp_positions`); a
Soroban pool's hold its share TOKEN. The count read only the first, so every
Soroban pool said `0` while 577 of them had holders — 4,183 in total.

The count now comes from `balance_aggregates.holder_count` joined on
`share_token_id`, which is a PK seek (`ORDER BY (asset_id)`) and rides the
instance subquery both queries already run. Verified against a direct count on
sampled tokens: identical. It is a periodic recompute, so eventually consistent
— the same terms the assets list already presents it on.

Production: the first Soroban page went from **0 of 20** pools showing
participants to **15 of 20**, 776 on the page, 337 at most. Classic unchanged.

### The list stays unlistable, and the page now says so

Counting is cheap; LISTING is not. `balances` is ordered `(holder_id,
asset_id)`, so filtering by asset is a full scan — **measured at 113M rows and
4.22 GiB for a single share token**, past the read-only profile's 4 GB. Every
other `balances` read in this API goes by holder for exactly that reason, so
there was no cheap mechanism to reuse.

Shipping the count alone would have inverted the very contradiction this task
started from: the strip saying 136 over a section saying "no participants yet".
The empty state now distinguishes them — "Participants not listed. This pool has
136 liquidity providers. Listing who they are is not indexed yet for this pool
type." Both surfaces agree, and neither claims something it does not know.

Making the list possible needs a schema change — a skip index on
`balances.asset_id`, or an asset→holders view. That is a decision with a write
side, not a read-half fix.

## The chart reads Soroban state changes — and a silent scale bug it exposed (2026-09-09)

The chart's reserve source is now chosen by kind: `liquidity_pool_snapshots` for
a classic pool, `pool_state_changes` for a Soroban one. Both yield the same four
columns, so the bucketing, the ASOF price joins and the TVL arithmetic are
untouched. Verified on production: a Soroban pool that returned "no activity in
this period" now returns real buckets — **1,465 samples in one day's bucket**.

`gross_volume_a` is NULL for a Soroban pool, deliberately. Nothing records its
volume: `pool_state_changes` carries reserves and nothing else, and inferring
volume from reserve deltas cannot tell a swap from a deposit. The volume and fee
series stay empty rather than invented.

TVL values are still null, and will be until the SAC re-key: **0 Soroban pools
have every leg priced today, 510 of 746 would after the repair** (simulated
read-only). The plumbing is verified; the numbers wait on the mutation.

### The scale bug — the reason to measure output, not just wire it

The per-leg reserves shipped in the previous commit looked right and were not.
`ResolvedAsset.decimals` is `coalesce(m.decimals, 7)`, so a leg with no metadata
reports 7 indistinguishably from a leg that really is 7. Soroban leg decimals
are NOT uniform — measured across the 304 distinct legs: 7 (294), **18 (3)**,
8 (2), 6 (4), 9 (1). A leg with 18 scaled as 7 is wrong by 10^11.

It showed up as a reserve of **128,249,398,883,656,900** on the live list —
found only by sweeping the API output for implausible magnitudes, not by any
test. The exact "plausible but wrong" failure this project keeps naming.

`ResolvedAsset` now carries `decimals_known` alongside `decimals`: true for a
classic or native asset, whose 7 is protocol, and for a Soroban token whose
contract publishes decimals — false otherwise. A raw reserve with no established
scale renders as nothing, in the leg AND in the chart.

The honest cost: **94 of 1,505 legs on the list carry a reserve today**, down
from 1,497 of which most were wrong. Of the 264 unscaled legs, **the SAC re-key
resolves 263** — a re-keyed leg is a classic asset and its 7 is protocol.

The guard needed a guard of its own: `a.asset_type IN (0, 1)` reads TRUE for an
unmatched LEFT JOIN, because the column default is 0 and 0 is `native`. The same
trap ate one of my measurement queries an hour earlier. It is `a.id != 0 AND
a.asset_type IN (0, 1)` now — the existing `known` column tests exactly that.

## W6 — the Soroban activity feed: what it would take (2026-09-09)

Investigated before building. The feed IS possible and the data is richer than
`pool_state_changes` suggested — but it is a two-vendor event decoder, not a
table wiring.

**First, a correction to my own earlier measurement.** I concluded "pool
contracts emit no events" from a query joining `soroban_events.contract_id`
(an `Int64` surrogate) against a strkey `String`. ClickHouse matched nothing and
I read that as absence. Joined on the surrogate, the events are there.

### What exists

`soroban_events` carries `transaction_id`, so hash, source account and timestamp
all join through `transactions` — everything the classic feed shows. And
`data_xdr` is JSON despite the name (the contract-events endpoint already parses
it that way), so the amounts need no XDR decoding.

Measured over ledgers > 64,000,000:

| shape                                  | events  | contracts | payload                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[swap, vec[tokenA, tokenB], account]` | 150,930 | 96        | `amount_0_in/out`, `amount_1_in/out`, `to`                                         |
| bare `[swap]`                          | 15,699  | 53        | `amount0`, `amount1`, `liquidity`, `sender`, `recipient`, `sqrt_price_x96`, `tick` |

The second is a CONCENTRATED-liquidity pool — `sqrt_price_x96` and `tick` are
the signature — and its amounts are SIGNED rather than split into in/out. So the
two families do not share a decoder, and the concentrated one is ranking item 6,
which was deliberately scheduled last.

### What it needs

1. Address the pool by its own contract surrogate. `plane_id` is that only for
   the pair-factory family (89 of the 149 actively-swapping contracts match it);
   the rest need `soroban_contracts` looked up by the pool's C-address, which
   the API already has.
2. A decoder per vendor shape, mapping to the existing signed `amount_a` /
   `amount_b` convention (positive = entered the pool).
3. Keyset pagination on `(ledger_sequence, transaction_id, event_index)`.
4. The `sync` events (2,479) are reserve updates, not user actions — they belong
   to the chart's series, not the activity list.

Comparable in size to the reserves, shares and participants work put together.
Not started; recorded so the next session begins from the measurement rather
than from `pool_state_changes`.
