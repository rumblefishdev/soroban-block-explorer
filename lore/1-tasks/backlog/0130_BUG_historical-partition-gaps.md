# DB: create historical partitions for backfill (2023-11 through 2026-03)

## Summary

Only Apr-Jun 2026 partitions exist for `soroban_events`, `soroban_invocations`, and
`liquidity_pool_snapshots`. Historical backfill (task 0030) will insert data from Nov 2023
through Mar 2026 — all of which lands in the DEFAULT partition, defeating the purpose of
partitioning and creating major query performance issues.

Splitting a populated DEFAULT partition later requires exclusive locks and data migration.
This MUST be done before backfill runs.

## Context

Task 0022 (partition management automation) is complete — the Lambda creates future
partitions 3+ months ahead. But it does not retroactively create historical partitions.

## Implementation

1. New migration: create monthly partitions from 2023-11 through 2026-03 (29 months) for
   all three partitioned tables.
2. Verify DEFAULT partition is empty before running (no data loss risk).
3. Run migration before historical backfill task 0030.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Monthly partitions exist for 2023-11 through 2026-03 on soroban_events
- [ ] Monthly partitions exist for 2023-11 through 2026-03 on soroban_invocations
- [ ] Monthly partitions exist for 2023-11 through 2026-03 on liquidity_pool_snapshots
- [ ] DEFAULT partitions remain empty after backfill
- [ ] Migration is idempotent (safe to re-run)
