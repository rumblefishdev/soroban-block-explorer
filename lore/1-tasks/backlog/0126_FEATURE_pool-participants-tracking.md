# LP: pool participants and share tracking

## Summary

The technical design specifies a "Pool participants" section on the LP detail page showing
liquidity providers and their share. No per-provider tracking exists in the current schema.

## Implementation

1. Create `liquidity_pool_participants` table (pool_id, account_id, shares, last_updated).
2. Track pool share changes from `LedgerEntryChanges` — trustline entries for pool shares.
3. Alternatively, derive from `soroban_events` or `soroban_invocations` for deposit/withdraw
   activity.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Per-provider pool shares trackable
- [ ] API endpoint returns participants for a given pool
- [ ] Shares updated on deposit/withdrawal events
