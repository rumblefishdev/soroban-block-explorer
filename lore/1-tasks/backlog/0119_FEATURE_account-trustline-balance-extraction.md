# Indexer: extract trustline balances for accounts

## Summary

`extract_account_states()` currently hardcodes a single native XLM balance. Trustline
balances (credit_alphanum4, credit_alphanum12) from `TrustLineEntry` LedgerEntry types
are never processed. The `balances` JSONB column was designed for a multi-balance array
but always contains `[{"asset_type": "native", "balance": X}]`.

## Context

The account detail page (task 0048/0073) needs to show all account balances — native XLM
plus all trustline positions. Without this, the explorer's account page is significantly
incomplete compared to competitors (StellarExpert, Stellarchain).

## Implementation

1. Process `trustline` entry type in `extract_ledger_entry_changes()` — extract asset code,
   issuer, balance, and limit.
2. Associate trustline entries with their parent account (trustline key contains account_id).
3. Merge trustline balances into the account's `balances` JSONB array alongside native XLM.
4. Handle trustline creation, update, and removal (deletion = balance removed from array).
5. Watermark logic: trustline updates should trigger account `last_seen_ledger` update.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `balances` JSONB contains native XLM + all trustline balances
- [ ] Trustline format: `{"asset_type": "credit_alphanum4", "asset_code": "USDC", "issuer": "G...", "balance": "100.0000000"}`
- [ ] Trustline removal correctly removes entry from balances array
- [ ] Watermark prevents stale trustline data from overwriting newer state
- [ ] Tests: account with native + 2 trustlines produces correct balances array
