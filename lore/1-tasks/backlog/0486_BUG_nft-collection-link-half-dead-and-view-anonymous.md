    note: >
      Found by adversarial review of 0472, which added the header chip that
      links an NFT contract to `/nfts?contract={C…}`. The link inherits two
      pre-existing pipeline gaps at once, and the destination view — newly
      addressable, but built as a filtered list — never says what collection
      it is showing.

# BUG: a link that fails half the time, to a page that does not say what it is

## The two halves

**1. The link is keyed on classification; the tokens land by a different
pipeline — and they disagree in both directions.** Measured on prod
(2026-08-13):

|                                                                              |        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| contracts classified NFT (`contract_type = 2`)                               | 132    |
| of those with ZERO rows in `nfts`                                            | **66** |
| contracts with rows only in `nfts_pending` (quarantined), classified `Other` | **67** |

Classification reads the WASM interface ("this contract IS an NFT");
`nfts` fills from events + the pending-promotion drain (task 0392's known
gap), and bespoke NFTs the classifier misses land as `Other` (the ~65-contract
classifier gap, task 0309 family). So half the linked pages render "No NFTs
match your filters", while 67 contracts that DO hold quarantined tokens get
no link at all.

**2. The destination is anonymous.** `/nfts?contract={C…}` renders the title
"NFTs", the generic subtitle, and a raw 56-char StrKey sitting in a free-text
search box. Nothing names the collection — although every row carries the
name, and the Contract ID column repeats the same value 20 times. The only
"Clear filters" affordance appears in the empty state and silently drops the
scope. A link labelled "View this collection" lands on a page that never says
which collection, or that it is a collection view at all.

## Scope

1. **Collection header.** When `contract` is set and passes `isContractId`,
   the list page titles itself as a collection view: the collection name
   (already on every row / in enrichment) or the truncated contract id,
   subtitle "NFTs issued by CBHU…A6GR" linking back to the contract page.
   Render the active contract filter as a removable chip, not typed text;
   hide the redundant Contract ID column in this mode.
2. **Honest empty state.** An empty collection reads "this collection has no
   indexed tokens" (with the pending caveat if applicable), not the generic
   "no NFTs match your filters" that blames the user's filter.
3. **Link gating — decide, do not default.** The contract endpoint carries no
   token count to gate on; adding one is 0483's API territory. Until then the
   options are: keep the always-on link (defensible once the empty state is
   honest) or hide it — record the call either way.

## Not in scope

- Promoting quarantined tokens (task 0392) or fixing the classifier (0309
  family) — this task makes the surface honest about their gaps, not close
  them.
- The collection NAME on the contract page chip itself — 0483.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `/nfts?contract={C…}` names the collection and links back to the
      contract; filter shown as a removable chip; vitest case
- [ ] Empty collection shows the honest empty state; vitest case
- [ ] Link-gating decision recorded (keep always-on vs gate via 0483)
- [ ] Docs: frontend-overview NFTs section
