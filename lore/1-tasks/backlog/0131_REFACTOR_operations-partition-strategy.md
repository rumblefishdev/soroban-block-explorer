# DB: fix operations partition strategy

## Summary

`operations` table is partitioned by `RANGE (transaction_id)` with only `operations_p0`
(0-10M) and `operations_default`. On Stellar mainnet with hundreds of millions of
transactions, virtually all data lands in DEFAULT. Partition pruning never activates for
typical API queries (by source_account, type, etc.).

## Implementation

Options:

1. **Drop partitioning** on operations (simplest — just a regular table).
2. **Switch to time-based partitioning** (add `created_at` column, match events/invocations
   pattern).
3. **Add more range partitions** (quick fix but doesn't solve query pattern mismatch).

Recommendation: Option 1 (drop partitioning) unless there's a specific need for partition
management on operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Operations table has a partition strategy that either (a) benefits queries or (b) is removed
- [ ] Existing data migrated without loss
- [ ] No FK or constraint breakage
