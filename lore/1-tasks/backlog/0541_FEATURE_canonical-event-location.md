      Filed from [[0540]]. `soroban_events` does not store which operation
      emitted an event, although the data exists across the whole ingested
      range — measured, not assumed: 1 265 of 1 265 archive transactions carry
      `TransactionMeta::V4` at protocols 20, 22 and 27, and all 1 770
      non-diagnostic token events carry an operation index. Three tasks already
      pay for the gap. Rides 0540's S3 pass.

      Re-scoped. Stellar's event identity, read from stellar-rpc's source, is
      total for every row `soroban_events` stores, so the schema's two reasons
      for our own flat `event_index` do not hold. Decided (option A): the
      canonical location becomes the sort key of `soroban_events`; the side
      table is its source and is dropped afterwards. The "micro-backend
      removed" criterion was wrong and is replaced. First table of the
      natural-key programme in 0538.

# soroban_event_ops

## Summary

Store which operation emitted each Soroban event. First as a **narrow side
table** written by 0540's S3 pass (the only additive write available), then
folded into two columns on `soroban_events` itself — see "Target shape" below
(decided 2026-09-07, reversing the "never as a column" stance this task was
filed with).

## Context

`xdr_parser` already computes the operation index: `extract_events` sets
`ExtractedEvent.op_index` from the CAP-67 V4 per-operation container.
`stage.rs` then drops it when building `SorobanEventRow`. The column simply
does not exist in ClickHouse.

Three consumers pay for that today:

| Task               | What it does instead                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **0453**           | Built a read-time "micro-backend": decodes `op_index` from archive XDR on **every** transaction-detail render, exposed as `XdrEventDto.op_index` |
| **0457** (Effects) | Will need the same attribution, for every event and not only token verbs                                                                         |
| **0540**           | Needs an S3 pass rather than a ClickHouse-local transform                                                                                        |

## Why a side table, not a column (original reasoning — superseded by "Target shape")

The obvious fix — `ALTER TABLE soroban_events ADD COLUMN op_index` — looked
wrong here, for the reason [[0540]] hit first:

- `soroban_events` is **10.4 bn rows / 223 GiB**, a version-less
  `ReplacingMergeTree`. Filling a new column means re-inserting **whole rows**,
  which then compete with the existing ones on the same sort key. Which row
  survives a merge is not controlled. This is the documented failure that made
  the 0383 backfill unsafe to re-run after the `net_settled` column landed.
- Rebuilding the table and swapping it (`EXCHANGE TABLES`, the house pattern)
  needs **both copies on disk**: ~446 GiB against 459 GiB free.

A side table avoids both: nothing competes, nothing is rewritten.

```
soroban_event_ops(
    ledger_sequence    Int64,
    application_order  Int16,    -- tx position in the ledger → transactions.id → soroban_events
    event_index        Int16,
    op_index           Int16,    -- envelope position of the emitting operation
    event_pos_in_op    Int16     -- position within that operation's container
)
```

Keyed by the transaction's position, not its id (see "Why now" for the
measurement: the id was 92% of the row). The join to `soroban_events` goes
through `transactions` on `(ledger_sequence, application_order)`, the same hop
`asset_transfers` makes.

Together, `(op_index, event_pos_in_op)` is Stellar's **official** event identity
(TOID plus position within the operation), which 0540 measured as total for
token verbs. It is **not** total for `soroban_events` as a whole — tx-level (fee)
and diagnostic events have no operation — so those rows are simply absent from
this table rather than carrying a null. Absence is the honest encoding: the
question "which operation emitted the fee charge" has no answer.

## Why now

0540's S3 re-parse decodes every event of every ledger anyway. Writing this
table on the same pass costs the extra inserts and nothing else. Done
separately it costs a second ~1-day pass over ~1 TB of XDR.

**Size, measured 2026-09-07** on 39.5 M local events with the final DDL: the
first DDL keyed the table like `soroban_events` (`ledger_sequence,
transaction_id, event_index`) and cost **5.07 B/row — 4.66 of them the
`transaction_id`**, a random hash that does not compress; the two payload
columns cost 0.24. Re-keyed by the transaction's position
(`ledger_sequence, application_order, event_index`, the join going through
`transactions` as `asset_transfers` does) it is **0.63 B/row → ~3.6 GB** on
~5.7 bn rows, instead of ~29 GB. The same two columns inside `soroban_events`
would cost 0.24 B/row (ZSTD) — ~2.5 GB on 10.4 bn rows — which is the target
shape above.

`event_pos_in_op` needed a one-line parser change (the per-operation loop in
`event.rs` did not `enumerate()` the events within the operation) — landed on
0540's branch.

## Target shape — a column on `soroban_events`, the side table as the vehicle (decided 2026-09-07)

The deep review of 0540 asked the principled question: where does the
operation index of an event belong? Canonically **on the event**. stellar-rpc
identifies an event by the cursor `(ledger, tx, op, event)` and, since
Protocol 23, returns the operation index as an attribute of each event in
`getEvents` (per the RPC docs — verify the field name when implementing). A
separate table keyed like `soroban_events` is the right data in the wrong
place; it exists only because filling a column on a 10.4 bn-row table looked
like a rewrite.

It is not. The reasoning above ("re-inserting whole rows", "`EXCHANGE TABLES`
needs both copies") misses ClickHouse mutations: `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` is
metadata-only and instant, and `ALTER TABLE … UPDATE col = …` rewrites **only
the mutated column's files** — every other column of the part is hard-linked
into the new part. Filling two `Int16` columns over 10.4 bn rows costs one
narrow column-write on the box, no S3, no second copy of the table.

So the side table is kept for 0540's pass — it is what the S3 pass can write
additively today, and it is the **source** for the fold — and the target is:

1. `ALTER TABLE soroban_events ADD COLUMN op_index Nullable(Int16), ADD COLUMN
event_pos_in_op Nullable(Int16)` — instant; NULL = "not yet folded, or a
   tx-level / diagnostic event" (the two must be told apart by the fold's
   completion, not by the value).
2. Live indexer writes both from the deploy on (`SorobanEventRow` gains two
   fields — same deploy-window rule as any struct change, driver validates
   against `DESCRIBE`).
3. History: one mutation **per partition**, sourced from `soroban_event_ops`
   joined to `transactions` on `(ledger_sequence, application_order)` to
   recover `transaction_id`, loaded into a `Join`-engine table for that
   partition (~200 M rows, ~5 GB in memory — fits; 125 GB box), `WHERE` on
   the partition key so each mutation touches one partition's parts.
4. Coverage gate: per partition, `countIf(op_index IS NULL)` on
   `soroban_events` equals the partition's tx-level + diagnostic event count.
5. `DROP TABLE soroban_event_ops`; 0453/0457 read the columns.

Why not do the column now: the live path change and the ALTER need their own
deploy window, and 0540's window is already carrying `DROP COLUMN
net_settled` plus three new tables. One schema change per window (0310).

## Implementation Plan

1. **Parser** — capture the position within the operation (one `enumerate()`).
2. **Row + staging** — new row type; extend the targeted-write mode 0540 adds so
   one pass writes both new tables and touches nothing else.
3. **Table** — create by hand on prod (`init.sql` is fresh-install only).
4. **Backfill** — rides 0540's pass.
5. **Consumers** — retire 0453's read-time decode; hand 0457 the join.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `soroban_event_ops` created, keyed like `soroban_events`
- [ ] Written by the same pass as 0540 — no second re-parse
- [ ] `soroban_events` is **not** re-inserted; the two columns are added by
      `ALTER` and filled by per-partition mutations from the side table (see
      "Target shape"), then the side table is dropped
- [ ] Coverage proven against the source: for a sampled range, every per-op
      event in the archive meta has a row, and no row exists for a tx-level or
      diagnostic event
- [ ] ~~0453's transaction-detail render reads the table instead of decoding
      XDR, and the micro-backend is removed~~ — withdrawn 2026-09-16: the
      micro-backend also serves signatures, envelope/result/meta XDR, the
      operation list and the invocation tree; `op_index` is one field of many
- [ ] **Docs updated** — `docs/architecture/database-schema/**` and
      `xdr-parsing/**` per ADR 0032

## Canonical event identity — measured and decided (2026-09-16)

### What Stellar defines (stellar-rpc v23+, read from source)

`getEvents` returns `id` = `%019d-%010d` of `TOID(ledger, tx, op)` and the event
number (`go-stellar-sdk/protocols/rpc/cursor.go`; built in stellar-rpc
`internal/db/event.go`, `InsertEvents`). The same string is the paging cursor
and sorts chronologically inside a ledger.

| Component | Meaning                                     | Base  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| ledger    | ledger sequence                             | —     |
| tx        | application order in the ledger             | **1** |
| op        | index into `TransactionMetaV4.operations[]` | **0** |
| event     | position **within the operation**           | **0** |

Transaction-level (fee) events are NOT id-less — they get sentinels by stage:
`BEFORE_ALL_TXS` → `(ledger, 0, 0, n)` counting across the ledger;
`AFTER_TX` → `(ledger, tx, 4095, n)` counting per tx;
`AFTER_ALL_TXS` → `(ledger, 1048575, 0, n)` counting across the ledger.
Diagnostic events get no id and are absent from `getEvents` since v23.
`transactionIndex` / `operationIndex` are returned per event since v23.0.0.
Before rpc v23 the id was `(ledger, tx, 0, index over the whole tx)` and is not
comparable with v23+ ids. SEP-35 / Horizon number operations from 1; rpc from 0.

### Where the project stands

|             | canonical location                                                          | ours                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| tables      | `asset_transfers`, `soroban_event_ops`, `transactions`, `transaction_memos` | `soroban_events`, `soroban_invocations_appearances`, the four presence indexes |
| transaction | `application_order` (1-based, = rpc tx)                                     | `transaction_id` = hash64 of the hash                                          |
| event       | `op_index`, `event_pos_in_op` (0-based, = rpc)                              | `event_index`: flat per tx, fee events first                                   |

Measured on production 2026-09-16: `transactions.application_order` runs 1..N;
`soroban_event_ops.op_index` / `event_pos_in_op` start at 0 — identical to rpc.
`soroban_event_ops`: 5.69 bn rows, 3.34 GiB, written live up to the ingest head,
**read by nothing**.

### Why the schema's defence of `event_index` does not hold

`init.sql` gives two reasons. (1) "Deterministic on replay" — true, and equally
true of the canonical identity, which is a function of the ledger meta alone
(the schema says so itself for `asset_transfers`). (2) "Not expressible for
fee and diagnostic events" — fee events have rpc ids (sentinels above, and the
parser already knows each one's `stage`); diagnostic events are not stored:
staging drops them (`stage.rs`, `is_diagnostic`). The comment is stale on both.

### What it costs today

- Contract events and contract invocations are ordered
  `(ledger, transaction_id, event_index)` (`api/src/contracts/queries.rs`), so
  events of different transactions in one ledger come out in hash order, not in
  execution order; inside a transaction the fee refund (settled after every
  transaction) is numbered before the operations.
- The event number on the transaction page cannot be matched to `getEvents`
  or any other tool.
- `soroban_events` is 235.95 GiB / 10.59 bn rows; its `transaction_id` column is
  **50.48 GiB (21%)**, `event_index` 4.69 GiB. Position columns sorted after the
  ledger cost 0.12–0.23 B/row (`asset_transfers`, `soroban_event_ops`).
- `application_order` names two things: the transaction's position in
  `transactions` / `asset_transfers` / `soroban_event_ops`, the operation's
  position in `operations_appearances` / `lp_operation_amounts`.

### Decision (karolkow, 2026-09-16) — option A

`soroban_events` is keyed by the canonical location:
`(contract_id, ledger_sequence, application_order, op_index, event_pos)` with
the rpc sentinels for fee events, and the API exposes the rpc-format id.

1. New table with the new key; filled per partition from `soroban_events` +
   `soroban_event_ops` + `transactions` (no S3); fee-event sentinels from the
   stage the parser already extracts (not stored today — the fill needs it).
2. Live writer switched in the same window; swap by `EXCHANGE TABLES`
   (indexer stopped, per `docs/backfills.md`).
3. Coverage gate per partition before the swap: row counts equal, every
   per-op event has a location, every fee event has a sentinel.
4. Readers: contract events and invocations in execution order; rpc ids on the
   wire; `#op-N` anchors possible; 0457 gets its attribution.
5. Drop `soroban_event_ops`; rewrite the stale `init.sql` comment; resolve the
   `application_order` double meaning.

Space: production free 368.72 GiB of 1.72 TiB (backups share the volume); the
new table is smaller than the 236 GiB it replaces — confirm per partition.
