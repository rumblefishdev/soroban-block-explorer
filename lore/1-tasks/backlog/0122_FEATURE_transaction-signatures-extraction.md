# Indexer: extract transaction signatures

## Summary

The technical design specifies showing "signer, weight, signature hex" on the transaction
detail page. The XDR parser does not extract signatures and the transactions table has no
signatures column.

## Implementation

1. Extract `signatures` from `TransactionEnvelope` during XDR parsing (they are in the
   envelope's `signatures` field — `Vec<DecoratedSignature>`).
2. Store as JSONB column on `transactions` table or decode from `envelope_xdr` at API time.
3. Recommendation: store at ingestion time (consistent with ADR 0004 — no server-side XDR).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Transaction signatures extracted and stored (JSONB array)
- [ ] Each signature includes: public key hint, signature hex
- [ ] API returns signatures in transaction detail response
