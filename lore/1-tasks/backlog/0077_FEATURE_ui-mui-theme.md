# UI lib: MUI theme configuration and explorer-specific styling

## Summary

Configure a custom MUI theme in `libs/ui/src/theme/` tailored for a data-first block explorer. MUI provides the base component and accessibility layer, but defaults must be overridden for explorer density, scanability, and network distinction. Export a ThemeProvider wrapper for the app.

## Status: Backlog

**Current state:** Not started.

## Context

MUI is the base component library for the explorer. However, MUI defaults are designed for general-purpose applications, not dense data explorers. The theme must be customized for:

- Data-first, scanability-focused layout
- Dense but readable table rows and summary cards
- Clear mainnet/testnet visual distinction
- Monospace typography for identifiers and data values
- WCAG AA contrast compliance for all text including secondary metadata and disabled states

MUI is used as a base component + accessibility layer, NOT as finished design. Every default that conflicts with explorer density must be overridden.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Custom palette

Create `libs/ui/src/theme/palette.ts`:

- Primary and secondary colors appropriate for a blockchain explorer
- Mainnet palette: distinct color set for mainnet environment
- Testnet palette: distinct color set for testnet environment (visually different enough to prevent confusion)
- Status colors: success (green-toned), error (red-toned) for transaction status badges
- Type colors: distinct colors for classic, SAC, and Soroban type badges
- Background and surface colors for light/dark mode readiness
- All colors WCAG AA compliant for text contrast

### Step 2: Typography

Create `libs/ui/src/theme/typography.ts`:

- Base font: clean sans-serif for general UI text
- Monospace font: for all identifier strings, hashes, addresses, XDR content
- Data table typography: slightly smaller, tighter line-height for dense tables
- Heading scale: `<h1>` through `<h6>` hierarchy for page structure
- Font sizes tuned for scanability in data-heavy contexts

### Step 3: Spacing and density

Create `libs/ui/src/theme/spacing.ts`:

- Compact spacing for table rows (denser than MUI defaults)
- Summary card padding: compact but readable
- Dense list row heights for collection pages
- Consistent spacing scale used across all components
- Breakpoints for responsive behavior

### Step 4: Component overrides

Create `libs/ui/src/theme/overrides.ts`:

- MUI Table: dense row height, tighter cell padding, border styling
- MUI Chip: compact for badges (status, type, network)
- MUI Button: appropriate sizing for pagination controls and actions
- MUI Tooltip: styled for identifier hover and copy confirmation
- MUI Tabs: explorer-appropriate tab styling
- MUI Skeleton: matching dimensions for table/card/detail skeletons

### Step 5: Theme assembly and ThemeProvider

Create `libs/ui/src/theme/theme.ts` and `libs/ui/src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`:

- Assemble palette, typography, spacing, and overrides into `createTheme()`
- Accept network parameter to switch between mainnet/testnet palettes
- Export `ExplorerThemeProvider` wrapper component
- Export raw theme object for use in tests or Storybook

### Step 6: Exports

Export `ExplorerThemeProvider` and theme utilities from `libs/ui` barrel.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Custom palette with mainnet/testnet distinction (visually clear)
- [ ] Status colors (success/error) and type colors (classic/SAC/soroban) defined
- [ ] All palette colors WCAG AA compliant for text contrast
- [ ] Monospace font configured for identifiers, hashes, addresses, XDR
- [ ] Data table typography: smaller, tighter for dense scanning
- [ ] Heading hierarchy (`<h1>`-`<h6>`) defined in typography
- [ ] Compact spacing for table rows, summary cards, and dense list rows
- [ ] MUI component overrides for: Table, Chip, Button, Tooltip, Tabs, Skeleton
- [ ] `ExplorerThemeProvider` accepts network parameter for mainnet/testnet switching
- [ ] Theme exported from `libs/ui` barrel
- [ ] Theme works as base for all UI components in `libs/ui`

## Notes

- This theme is consumed by every other frontend task. It should be implemented early.
- MUI defaults are intentionally generic. The overrides in this task encode the explorer's specific design decisions.
- Mainnet/testnet palette distinction is critical for preventing user confusion when switching networks.
- Dark mode is not required for initial launch but the palette structure should not preclude it.
