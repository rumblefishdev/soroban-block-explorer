# Cleanup: remove Event Interpreter references from backlog and docs

## Summary

Event Interpreter Lambda was removed from the architecture (commit 7c961e6). Active tasks (0018, 0026, 0033) are being updated separately. This task cleans up remaining references in backlog tasks, architecture docs, and the lore index.

## Context

The simplified architecture has 2 Lambdas (API + Indexer), no Event Interpreter. The `event_interpretations` table has no producer and should be removed from schema docs and task descriptions. Several backlog tasks still reference LEFT JOINs on this table, `human_readable` fields, and task 0056.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Delete obsolete files

- `lore/1-tasks/backlog/0056_FEATURE_workers-event-interpreter.md` → cancel or move to `.trash/`
- `apps/workers/` → move to `.trash/` (TS stub, sole purpose was event interpretation)

### Step 2: Update backlog tasks

- **0028** — remove `soroban_events -> event_interpretations` from CASCADE chain
- **0046** — remove LEFT JOIN `event_interpretations`, all `human_readable` fields from response examples, AC about event_interpretations, notes about enrichment deferral
- **0050** — remove `interpretation` field from response, `human_readable` from response example, LEFT JOIN references, AC, notes about enrichment deferral
- **0070** — remove `human_readable` from response example JSON, remove note about summaries coming from `human_readable` field
- **0088** — remove disclaimers about "Event Interpreter tests deferred" and "no separate Event Interpreter Lambda in current architecture"

### Step 3: Update architecture docs

- **`docs/architecture/database-schema/database-schema-overview.md`** — remove section 4.7 (Event Interpretations DDL), `event_interpretations` from relationship diagram, mentions of enrichment layer and periodic enrichment writes
- **`docs/architecture/technical-design-general-overview.md`** — remove section 6.7 (Event Interpretations), `human_readable` from response example, mentions of event interpretation in testing/risks sections
- **`docs/architecture/backend/backend-overview.md`** — remove `human_readable` from response example, mentions of "event interpretations" in response shaping, "readable interpretations" and "structured interpretations" references, "interpretation responsibility" mention
- **`docs/architecture/xdr-parsing/xdr-parsing-overview.md`** — remove mention of event interpretation jobs working from persisted events

### Step 4: Regenerate lore index

- Run `lore-framework_generate-index` to update `lore/README.md` (currently lists 0056 as backlog task)

## Out of scope

- **Active tasks (0018, 0026, 0033)** — updated separately by their assignees
- **Archived tasks (0002, 0005, 0006, 0008, 0010, 0085, 0093)** — closed, history preserved as-is
- **Already updated tasks (0036, 0037, 0040)** — only have history entries noting the removal, no stale content
- **Tasks 0044, 0065** — mention "human-readable" in UI/response shaping context, not Event Interpreter
- **`.claude/skills/`** — pr and branch skills reference archived 0008 as examples, not functional dependencies

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Task 0056 canceled or deleted
- [ ] `apps/workers/` removed
- [ ] Backlog tasks 0028, 0046, 0050, 0070, 0088 updated — no references to `event_interpretations`, `Event Interpreter`, or task 0056
- [ ] Architecture docs updated — no `event_interpretations` DDL, no Event Interpreter mentions
- [ ] `lore/README.md` regenerated without 0056
- [ ] Wiki snapshot updated to reflect simplified architecture (no Event Interpreter, no `event_interpretations` table)
- [ ] Verification: grep for `event_interpretations`, `Event Interpreter`, `0056` across non-archive files returns zero hits
