-- Endpoint:     GET /liquidity-pools
-- Purpose:      Paginated list of liquidity pools with their latest
--               on-chain state (reserves, total shares, TVL). Optional
--               filters: asset pair, minimum TVL.
-- Source:       backend-overview.md §6.3 / frontend-overview.md §6.13
-- Schema:       ADR 0037
-- Data sources: DB-only.
-- Inputs:
--   $1  :limit                    INT            page size
--   $2  :cursor_created_at_ledger BIGINT         NULL on first page
--   $3  :cursor_pool_id           BYTEA(32)      NULL on first page
--   $4  :asset_a_code             VARCHAR        NULL = no filter
--   $5  :asset_a_issuer_strkey    VARCHAR(56)    NULL = no filter
--   $6  :asset_b_code             VARCHAR        NULL = no filter
--   $7  :asset_b_issuer_strkey    VARCHAR(56)    NULL = no filter
--   $8  :min_tvl                  NUMERIC(28,7)  NULL = no filter
-- Indexes:      idx_pools_asset_a / idx_pools_asset_b (asset filters),
--               idx_pools_created_at_ledger ON (created_at_ledger DESC, pool_id DESC)
--                  — exact keyset walk; added in task 0132 migration
--                  `20260428000100_add_endpoint_query_indexes`,
--               idx_lps_pool ON (pool_id, created_at DESC) — for the
--                  latest-snapshot lateral lookup.
-- Notes:
--   • Default ordering is `(created_at_ledger DESC, pool_id DESC)`: newest
--     pools first, deterministic on tie. We deliberately do NOT order by
--     latest-snapshot TVL — that field can be NULL (TVL ingestion is a
--     future task) and would force a NULLS-LAST cursor that is hard to
--     keep keyset-stable. TVL is still surfaced and filterable; the caller
--     can sort client-side within a page or the endpoint can be expanded
--     with an explicit `?sort=tvl` once TVL is populated.
--   • Latest snapshot per pool is fetched via a LATERAL with `LIMIT 1`,
--     no time-bound predicate. Pool reserves/total_shares only change on
--     deposit/withdraw/swap events (snapshot triggers are state-change
--     driven — see `xdr_parser::extract_liquidity_pools`), so the latest
--     snapshot is always the actual current on-chain state regardless of
--     age. Clients that care about staleness can read `latest_snapshot_at`
--     in the response. (`tvl`/`volume`/`fee_revenue` are populated by a
--     future TVL-ingestion task; today they are NULL on every snapshot.)
--   • Asset-leg filter accepts native (`code IS NULL` / `issuer IS NULL`)
--     by leaving both code and issuer params NULL, OR explicit classic
--     identity (both non-NULL). Mixed (one NULL one not) is undefined —
--     the API validates inputs upstream.
--   • Issuer StrKeys resolve via a CTE with the `accounts.account_id`
--     UNIQUE index, then are surfaced via final joins.
--   • Sentinel placeholder pools (ADR 0041 / task 0193) are excluded
--     via `lp.created_at_ledger > 0`. The persist layer emits these
--     rows (`created_at_ledger = 0`, NULL/0 asset/fee fields) to
--     satisfy the `lp_positions.pool_id` FK during partial backfills
--     when the parent pool was created in a pre-window ledger and
--     never touched in the current one; they self-heal on the next
--     ledger touch via the 13a UPSERT. The list endpoint hides them
--     until they carry real data. Pubnet genesis seq is 1, so `> 0`
--     excludes every sentinel without rejecting any real pool.
