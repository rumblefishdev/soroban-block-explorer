-- Endpoint:     GET /liquidity-pools/:id
-- Purpose:      Pool detail: identity (asset pair, fee, created_at_ledger) +
--               latest on-chain state (reserves, total shares, TVL).
-- Source:       backend-overview.md §6.3 / frontend-overview.md §6.14
-- Schema:       ADR 0037
-- Data sources: DB-only.
-- Inputs:
--   $1  :pool_id            BYTEA(32)  raw 32-byte pool id
-- Indexes:      liquidity_pools PK (pool_id),
--               idx_lps_pool ON (pool_id, created_at DESC),
--               idx_lpp_shares (pool_id, shares DESC) WHERE shares > 0
--                  — partial index covering the participant-count
--                  subquery (task 0246).
-- Notes:
--   • Single statement. The latest-snapshot subquery is `LIMIT 1` on
--     `idx_lps_pool` — one index seek.
--   • No freshness-window predicate. Pool reserves/total_shares only
--     change on deposit/withdraw/swap events (snapshot triggers are
--     state-change driven — see `xdr_parser::extract_liquidity_pools`),
--     so the latest snapshot is always the actual current on-chain state
--     regardless of its age. Clients that care about freshness can read
--     `latest_snapshot_at` in the response. `tvl`/`volume`/`fee_revenue`
--     are NULL today (populated by a future TVL-ingestion task).
--   • Issuer StrKeys via final joins. Native legs (asset_*_type = 0) have
--     NULL issuer_id; LEFT JOIN yields NULL.
--   • `participant_count` (task 0246) is a correlated subquery hitting
--     the partial index `idx_lpp_shares`. Same projection as file 18 so
--     the wire DTO stays uniform across list + detail. Not snapshot-bound
--     — populated even on stale pools.
--   • Sentinel placeholder pools (ADR 0041 / task 0193) are excluded
--     via `lp.created_at_ledger > 0`. Sentinel rows carry
--     `created_at_ledger = 0` and minimum-data NULL/0 asset/fee
--     fields; they exist only to satisfy `lp_positions.pool_id` FK
--     during partial backfills. The detail query returning no row
--     causes the handler to surface 404 — the desired outcome for a
--     pool whose real on-chain shape has not yet been observed.
