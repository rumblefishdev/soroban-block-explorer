-- Endpoint:     GET /liquidity-pools/:id/transactions
-- Purpose:      Paginated transactions touching a given pool — deposits,
--               withdrawals, and trades. Default: most recent first.
-- Source:       backend-overview.md §6.3 / frontend-overview.md §6.14
-- Schema:       ADR 0037
-- Data sources: DB-only.
-- Inputs:
--   $1  :pool_id             BYTEA(32)    raw 32-byte pool id
--   $2  :limit               INT          page size
--   $3  :cursor_created_at   TIMESTAMPTZ  NULL on first page
--   $4  :cursor_tx_id        BIGINT       NULL on first page
-- Indexes:      idx_ops_app_pool ON (pool_id, created_at DESC) WHERE pool_id IS NOT NULL,
--               transactions PK (id, created_at) — composite-FK join.
-- Notes:
--   • Driver is `operations_appearances` filtered by `pool_id`. The partial
--     index `idx_ops_app_pool` is keyed exactly on this shape, so the
--     planner walks it directly with the cursor predicate.
--   • The WHERE clause keeps `pool_id IS NOT NULL` implicitly (we filter by
--     a concrete pool_id), so the partial index remains usable.
--   • DISTINCT ON deduplicates when one tx has multiple ops touching the
--     same pool (rare but valid — multi-op transactions).
--   • Frontend §6.14 expanded: "Transaction history should distinguish
--     between trade activity and liquidity management activity." We
--     surface the full op-type list per tx so the frontend can categorize
--     each row (LP-mgmt op types: liquidity_pool_deposit /
--     liquidity_pool_withdraw; trade op types: path_payment_*, manage_*,
--     create_passive_sell_offer, etc.). Categorization is policy, not SQL —
--     the frontend owns the "is this a trade" rule.
--   • Sentinel placeholder pools (ADR 0041 / task 0193) are filtered at
--     two layers: (1) the handler-level `pool_exists()` gate returns
--     404 for sentinel pool ids before this query runs; (2) an EXISTS
--     subquery against `liquidity_pools` inside `matched_ops` provides
--     defense-in-depth so any future caller that bypasses the handler
--     still gets an empty result. Sentinels have no
--     `operations_appearances` rows by construction (they exist only to
--     satisfy the `lp_positions.pool_id` FK), so the guard is
--     belt-and-suspenders but cheap (uncorrelated PK seek).
