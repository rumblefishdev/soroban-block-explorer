-- Endpoint:     GET /assets/:id/transactions
-- Purpose:      Paginated transactions involving a given asset. The driver
--               table is `operations_appearances`, filtered by either
--               (asset_code, asset_issuer_id) for classic-form references
--               or by `contract_id` for SAC/Soroban-form references.
-- Source:       backend-overview.md §6.3 / frontend-overview.md §6.9
-- Schema:       ADR 0037
-- Data sources: DB-only.
-- Inputs:
--   $1  :asset_id            INT          assets surrogate id
--   $2  :limit               INT          page size
--   $3  :cursor_created_at   TIMESTAMPTZ  NULL on first page
--   $4  :cursor_tx_id        BIGINT       NULL on first page
-- Indexes:      assets PK (id),
--               idx_ops_app_asset    ON (asset_code, asset_issuer_id, created_at DESC) WHERE asset_code IS NOT NULL,
--               idx_ops_app_contract ON (contract_id, created_at DESC)                  WHERE contract_id IS NOT NULL,
--               transactions PK (id, created_at) — composite-FK join.
-- Notes:
--   • Two statement variants. The API picks one based on the asset's type
--     (read in the same transaction or from a small in-memory cache):
--       — Variant A: classic_credit (1) and SAC (2) referenced via the
--         classic identity tuple. Hits idx_ops_app_asset.
--       — Variant B: SAC (2) referenced via contract identity, and
--         soroban-native (3). Hits idx_ops_app_contract.
--     SAC has BOTH a classic identity and a contract identity; the API
--     SHOULD merge results from both variants (or pick one based on the
--     UX — typically classic for SAC) and dedupe on transaction_id.
--   • Native (asset_type=0) has no canonical row-level filter on
--     operations_appearances; the API may either return an empty list or
--     fall back to a global recent-transactions slice. The SQL here has
--     no native-specific path because the schema doesn't either.
--   • DISTINCT ON keeps one row per transaction even when a tx has
--     multiple ops touching the asset.
--   • Both variants use the partial indexes' predicate shape — the WHERE
--     clauses NEVER drop `asset_code IS NOT NULL` / `contract_id IS NOT NULL`,
--     so the partial indexes remain usable.
