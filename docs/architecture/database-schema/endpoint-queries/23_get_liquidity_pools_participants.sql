-- Endpoint:     GET /liquidity-pools/:id/participants
-- Purpose:      Paginated list of liquidity providers in a pool, ordered by
--               share size descending. Powers the "Pool participants" table
--               on the LP detail page (frontend §6.14).
-- Source:       frontend-overview.md §6.14 (UI element) — added to
--               backend-overview.md §6.2 in this PR; previously absent
--               from the API surface (doc drift caught by the §6.14 vs §6.2
--               cross-check during task 0167).
-- Schema:       ADR 0037 §16 (`lp_positions`)
-- Data sources: DB-only.
-- Inputs:
--   $1  :pool_id              BYTEA(32)    raw 32-byte pool id
--   $2  :limit                INT          page size
--   $3  :cursor_shares        NUMERIC(28,7)  NULL on first page
--   $4  :cursor_account_id    BIGINT       NULL on first page
-- Indexes:      idx_lpp_shares ON lp_positions (pool_id, shares DESC) WHERE shares > 0,
--               accounts PK (id) for StrKey join.
-- Notes:
--   • Keyset on (shares DESC, account_id DESC). The partial index
--     `idx_lpp_shares` is keyed exactly on `(pool_id =, shares DESC)` and
--     is partial `WHERE shares > 0`, so we KEEP `lpp.shares > 0` in the
--     WHERE shape to remain index-eligible. Zero-share rows are
--     historical residue (post-withdrawal positions); they don't belong
--     in a "current participants" view.
--   • `share_percentage` is computed against the pool's latest
--     `total_shares` snapshot. We pick the latest snapshot via a
--     correlated LATERAL with a freshness window — the same pattern as
--     file 19. If no snapshot in the window, the percentage is NULL and
--     the API surfaces it as "—" (consistent with stale-pool handling
--     in the list endpoint, file 18).
--   • The percentage divisor is fetched ONCE per page (not per row): we
--     hoist the latest-snapshot lookup into a CTE keyed by pool_id, then
--     join it to every position row. One snapshot lookup, N position rows.
--   • `first_deposit_ledger` and `last_updated_ledger` give the API
--     enough to display "joined N ago" / "last activity N ago" if the
--     UI design needs it (the §6.14 spec doesn't require it explicitly,
--     but the columns are free since the row is already being read).
--   • Sentinel placeholder pools (ADR 0041 / task 0193) are filtered at
--     two layers: (1) the handler-level `pool_exists()` gate returns
--     404 for sentinel pool ids before this query runs; (2) an EXISTS
--     subquery against `liquidity_pools` in the main WHERE provides
--     defense-in-depth. A sentinel pool can legitimately have non-zero
--     `lp_positions` (it was emitted *because* a position referenced
--     it) — without the EXISTS guard, a direct caller bypassing the
--     handler would surface "participants of a pool you can't see".
