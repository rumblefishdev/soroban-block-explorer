-- Endpoint:     GET /liquidity-pools/:id/chart
-- Purpose:      Time-bucketed series for a pool: TVL, volume, fee revenue.
--               Used by the LP detail charts (frontend §6.14).
-- Source:       backend-overview.md §6.3 / frontend-overview.md §6.14
-- Schema:       ADR 0037
-- Data sources: DB-only.
-- Inputs:
--   $1  :pool_id   BYTEA(32)    raw 32-byte pool id
--   $2  :interval  TEXT         '1h' | '1d' | '1w' — the user-facing
--                                vocabulary, validated by the API against
--                                an explicit allowlist before the SQL is
--                                invoked. The query maps it to a Postgres
--                                `date_trunc` keyword via an inline CASE.
--   $3  :from      TIMESTAMPTZ  inclusive lower bound
--   $4  :to        TIMESTAMPTZ  exclusive upper bound
-- Indexes:      idx_lps_pool ON (pool_id, created_at DESC).
-- Notes:
--   • The user-facing interval vocabulary `'1h' | '1d' | '1w'` is the
--     endpoint contract; `date_trunc` itself wants `'hour' | 'day' | 'week'`.
--     We map between the two with a single CASE expression at query time
--     (cheap; the result is constant across all rows for a given call).
--     The API's allowlist validation MUST stay in place — passing
--     untrusted text into the CASE's `ELSE` branch would error at runtime
--     and is a defensive guarantee against accidental sub-second buckets.
--   • Aggregation policy:
--       — TVL  : last value in bucket (state at close of bucket)
--       — volume / fee_revenue : SUM (cumulative within bucket)
--     Pools that didn't snapshot in a given bucket simply have no row
--     for that bucket — the frontend interpolates if needed.
--   • `idx_lps_pool` covers the leading equality on pool_id and the
--     range on created_at; the CASE-derived bucket expression is a
--     constant within one call, not a per-row-evaluated function on the
--     indexed column, so it doesn't break index usability.
--   • Sentinel placeholder pools (ADR 0041 / task 0193) are filtered at
--     two layers: (1) the handler-level `pool_exists()` gate returns
--     404 for sentinel pool ids before this query runs; (2) an EXISTS
--     subquery against `liquidity_pools` in the main WHERE provides
--     defense-in-depth so any future caller that bypasses the handler
--     still gets an empty result. Sentinels have no snapshots by
--     construction; the guard is belt-and-suspenders but cheap
--     (uncorrelated PK seek).
