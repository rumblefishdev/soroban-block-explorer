//! The checkpoint-snapshot seed (task 0463 step 3d, ADR 0055) — build every
//! correction the four-way comparison proved necessary, as INSERT-ready rows.
//!
//! ## What it writes (with `--execute`; without it, artifacts + counts only)
//!
//! | correction | rows measured 2026-08-18 | version ledger | closed_at |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | missing live holding | ~19.3M classic | the ENTRY's own `lastModifiedLedgerSeq` | 0 |
//! | closure (ours 0, gone) | ~22.2M classic + 2.3M native | checkpoint | checkpoint |
//! | ghost (ours >0, gone) | ~1.04M native + ~2k classic | checkpoint | checkpoint |
//! | self-heal (snapshot newer) | ~25k | the entry's own ledger | 0 |
//! | `account_entry_state` full seed | every live account | the entry's own ledger | — |
//! | `assets` / `accounts` dimension stubs | the referenced ids we lack | entry ledger | — |
//!
//! ## The versioning contract (the load-bearing part)
//!
//! - **Live data always versions on the entry's own `lastModifiedLedgerSeq`**,
//!   never a window boundary — the task 0492 defect. The live parser's newer
//!   writes then win regardless of load order.
//! - **Closures version on the checkpoint ledger.** There is no entry left to
//!   carry a ledger, and the checkpoint IS the ledger of the observation
//!   "this is gone". `closed_at_ledger` gets the same value and therefore
//!   means "closed AT OR BEFORE this ledger" for seeded rows (the writer's own
//!   stamps are exact). Side effect: every seed-stamped closure shares the run's
//!   checkpoint value — a recognisable cohort, which is the only provenance we
//!   have until task 0492 lands a real convention.
//! - **Ghosts (positive-but-absent) are corrected AND reported, never silent.**
//!   The standing policy said "anomaly report, not silent closure" back when
//!   these were presumed ingestion gaps; RPC verification (100/100 sampled
//!   accounts ABSENT on chain, amounts byte-checked) proved them real
//!   removals, so option A applies — `amount = 0` together with
//!   `closed_at_ledger` — but the full list still lands in the artifacts dir.
//!
//! ## Deployment order — DO NOT reorder
//!
//! 1. Deploy the lifecycle writer (stage.rs stamps closures itself).
//! 2. THEN run this seed against a checkpoint taken AFTER that deploy.
//!
//! Reversed, every removal between the checkpoint and the deploy is written by
//! the OLD writer as a plain `amount = 0, closed_at = 0` row with a ledger
//! ABOVE the checkpoint — it outversions the seed's closure and resurrects the
//! ghost. The 12-minute window of task 0310 taught the same lesson.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately NOT seeded here
//!
//! - **Pool-share trustlines** (77,048 live) — they live in `lp_positions`
//!   until the ADR 0056 merge lands. The archive is content-addressed (bucket
//!   files keyed by hash), so the LP pass re-derives this snapshot from the
//!   manifest JSON saved into the artifacts dir; nothing else must be kept.
//! - **Type-3 / contract-held holdings** — different ledger entry type
//!   (`ContractData`); their audit is task 0503 on the same decoder.
//!
//! ## Why the `assets` stubs need no RMT version
//!
//! `assets` is `ReplacingMergeTree` with NO version column, keyed on the
//! identity 4-tuple — on merge ClickHouse keeps the last-inserted row per
//! key. That is safe here because every field of an `AssetRow` (including the
//! `id` surrogate) is a pure function of that same identity tuple: any two
//! rows ever written for one key are byte-identical, so it cannot matter
//! which survives. Stubs are additionally emitted only for ids absent from
//! the known-id set read from ClickHouse, so they never contend with an existing row.
