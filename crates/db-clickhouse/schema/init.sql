-- ClickHouse production schema (task 0206 + 0208 + ADR 0044 amendments).
--
-- ## Design — hybrid: surrogate Int64 for high-cardinality join hubs,
-- natural keys everywhere else
--
-- Three tables get surrogate `id Int64` columns (deterministic
-- `cityhash64(natural_key)` derivation in
-- `crates/db-clickhouse/src/persist/ids.rs`):
--
--   - `accounts.id`            ← cityhash64(account_id StrKey)
--   - `soroban_contracts.id`   ← cityhash64(contract_id StrKey)
--   - `transactions.id`        ← cityhash64(hash bytes)
--
-- These three are the **central FK hubs** — referenced by 6–8
-- downstream tables each. Tens of millions of unique values at full
-- mainnet scale. Empirical measurement (10k-ledger smoke):
-- plain-String / LowCardinality FK columns added ~500 MB on disk vs
-- a hash-i64 baseline, projected ~550 GB on the full 11M-ledger
-- backfill. Int64 FK columns ~4× smaller pre-compression and
-- significantly cheaper on JOIN / GROUP BY because CH compares
-- integers in a single CPU op vs variable-length string memcmp.
--
-- Other tables (`assets`, `nfts`, `liquidity_pools`,
-- `liquidity_pool_snapshots`, `operations_appearances`,
-- `transaction_participants`, `nft_ownership`, `lp_positions`,
-- `account_balances_current`, `wasm_interface_metadata`,
-- `ledgers`, `transaction_hash_index`) keep their natural / composite
-- primary keys — no surrogate `id`. Composite (StrKey-or-hash, …)
-- ORDER BYs work cheaply for these without a hash layer.
--
-- ## Why deterministic `cityhash64(natural_key)` for the surrogate IDs
--
-- - **Replay-idempotency** — `ReplacingMergeTree` dedups by
--   `ORDER BY`; replays must produce the same `id` for the same
--   natural key so the merger collapses duplicates from a re-run.
-- - **Parallel-writer safety** — K runners on disjoint partition
--   ranges all compute the same `id` for the same StrKey without
--   coordination.
-- - **Cross-table FK consistency** — every `source_id` /
--   `account_id` / `deployer_id` / etc. across the schema is
--   `cityhash64(strkey)` of the referenced account; every
--   `contract_id` FK column is `cityhash64(strkey)` of the
--   referenced contract; every `transaction_id` FK column is
--   `cityhash64(tx_hash_bytes)`.
--
-- Hash algorithm: `cityhash-rs::cityhash_102_128` (CityHash v1.0.2
-- 128-bit) lower 64 bits. **Not bit-equivalent to CH SQL
-- `cityHash64()`** (CH builtin is the 64-bit variant of CityHash
-- 1.0.2 — a different algorithm from the lower-half of the
-- 128-bit). Future CH-side queries that want to recompute an `id`
-- must call the writer's helper or add a UDF.
--
-- ## Other production design choices
--
-- - **`ReplacingMergeTree` for every state-shaped table.** Including
--   `liquidity_pools` (was `MergeTree` in pilot, ~20× duplication
--   per task 0208 observation; now folded inline). Background merger
--   collapses by `ORDER BY` key.
-- - **`LowCardinality(String)`** on bounded-cardinality columns:
--   asset codes, event signatures, home_domain.
-- - **`ZSTD(3)` codecs** on JSON-ish columns: `soroban_events.topics_xdr`,
--   `soroban_events.data_xdr`, `wasm_interface_metadata.metadata`.
-- - **Empty-string sentinel** for composite-PK "no value" slots
--   (`assets.asset_code = ''` for native, etc.). CH `ORDER BY` on
--   plain `String` is significantly faster than `Nullable(String)`.
-- - **`account_balances_current` trustline removals → `balance = 0`
--   rows**; reads filter `WHERE balance > 0`. No tombstone engine.
--
-- ## Engine assignment
--
--   - append-only fact tables  → ReplacingMergeTree (dedup by ORDER BY)
--   - state tables             → ReplacingMergeTree(version_column) where
--                                a natural NOT NULL ledger column exists
--                                (otherwise plain ReplacingMergeTree)
--   - immutable lookup tables  → ReplacingMergeTree (collapse re-run /
--                                parallel-merge duplicates; lore-0293)
--
-- Partitioning: every fact table uses `intDiv(ledger_sequence, 500000)`
-- (~29 days at 5 s/ledger). State and immutable tables not partitioned.
--
-- All statements are idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`,
-- `CREATE DICTIONARY IF NOT EXISTS`); applying twice is a no-op.

-- duplicates; were plain MergeTree until lore-0293)

-- ReplacingMergeTree (was plain MergeTree): the commit marker. A normal

-- the ABSENT marker), but parallel-backfill merges / range overlap / manual
-- re-index DO produce duplicate `sequence` rows that plain MergeTree never
-- collapses — they double `ledgers` JOINs and needed a manual
-- `OPTIMIZE … DEDUPLICATE BY sequence` (task 0228). RMT collapses them
-- automatically on merge. Content is immutable per `sequence`, so no version
-- column; cost is merge-time only and ~0 on a unique monotonic key; reads stay
-- FINAL-free. (lore-0293)

-- ── Option C unified balance model (task 0331) ──────────────────────────────
-- The two tables below are the unified replacement for `account_balances_current`
-- (classic) + the interim `soroban_token_balances` (type-3). The persist path now
-- writes `balances` ONLY (single-write, task 0331 Option A); `account_balances_current`
-- is retained (no longer written) pending the one-time classic→`balances` data
-- migration + drop (OPS steps 6b/6d). See the task README.

-- Unified per-holder balances — the single balance model for ALL asset types.
-- `amount` is RAW `Int128` (scale by the asset's `decimals` at read — universal
-- fixed-point, handles classic 7-dec AND arbitrary Soroban decimals). `holder_id`
-- = `cityhash64(holder StrKey)` (the same surrogate space as `accounts.id` /
-- `soroban_contracts.id`; resolve back to a StrKey via `accounts` (G) or
-- `soroban_contracts` (C) — there is no dedicated address dimension). `asset_id`
-- → the `assets.id` surrogate (`ids::asset_id`). RMT version = `last_updated_ledger`;
-- a removed/zeroed balance writes 0 so a fully-spent holder collapses.
-- `closed_at_ledger` (ADR 0055): 0 = the holding relationship is live, >0 = the
-- ledger in which the entry disappeared from the chain. Before it existed a
-- removal was written as `amount = 0`, byte-identical to a live-but-empty
-- holding, so the read path could not tell them apart and hid both. Ledger 0
-- does not exist (genesis is 1), so 0 is a safe live sentinel. `DEFAULT 0` is
-- load-bearing: the CH driver rejects inserts client-side when the table has a
-- column the writer's struct does not know AND the column has no default, so
-- the default is what lets the `ALTER` land before the writer deploys.
-- PROD: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` does NOT add a column to an existing
-- table, so an already-created database needs the ALTERs run by hand — the
-- same convention as `assets.id` above. Both are metadata-only (no data
-- rewrite) and were applied to production on 2026-08-18, verified with

-- nothing settled net. Without the distinction a value that could not be computed
-- would masquerade as a real zero. The read filters `IS NOT NULL AND != 0`.
-- NON-KEY data column, version-less RMT: `net_settled` has a SINGLE writer —
-- `stage.rs`, run by both live ingest and the full S3 re-ingest — so live and

-- cleanly. The read dedups with `max(net_settled)` (`max` ignores NULL, so a
-- computed value wins over a not-computed one for the same key). There is
-- deliberately no version column: a downward "correction" of a deterministic
-- figure only happens when OUR reducer changes, which is a deploy event handled
-- by re-running the re-ingest + `OPTIMIZE FINAL` over the range —
-- not a runtime concern worth a per-row version + a full-table engine rebuild.

-- the value lookup for the page's (ledger, tx) set.
--
-- ROW GRAIN = (operation, pool, asset), with the op's claim atoms PRE-SUMMED
-- in Rust before the insert. NOT one row per atom: a single op can take the
-- same pool several times (CAP-38 interleaved order-book/AMM matching) and
-- every such atom carries the IDENTICAL ORDER BY tuple, so the RMT would keep
-- one and silently drop the rest of the fill. A per-op sum is deterministic on
-- replay, so live ingest and the historical re-parse emit byte-identical rows
-- for a key and the duplicate collapses cleanly (the single-writer argument
-- of `operation_asset_appearances.net_settled`, same reducer both paths).
--
-- `amount` is SIGNED FROM THE POOL'S PERSPECTIVE: positive = the asset entered
-- the pool, negative = it left. The sign pattern therefore names the event
-- with no type column — trade `+/-`, deposit `+/+`, withdrawal `-/-` — and the
-- two rows of one (op, pool) are its two legs. RAW STROOPS in `Int64`, scaled
-- by 7 at read like every other amount here: classic AMM pools are 7-decimal
-- by definition, the XDR sources (`ClaimLiquidityAtom.amount_{sold,bought}`,
-- trustline balance deltas) ARE `int64`, and a per-op sum is bounded by the
-- pool's own `int64` reserve, so no overflow is reachable. Deliberately not
-- `Int128` (that width exists in `net_settled` for Soroban i128 token amounts,
-- which a classic pool cannot carry) and not `Decimal128(7)` (the read-model
-- choice in `liquidity_pool_snapshots` for the Lambda's USD math — fact tables
-- store raw ints, and the cross-check below is one cast away).
--
-- `asset_id` = the `ids::asset_id` surrogate shared with
-- `operation_asset_appearances` / `balances`; native XLM is the first-class
-- `NATIVE_ASSET_ID`, never an empty sentinel. A pool's rows are always its two
-- legs, so the read renders against the pool definition it already holds.
--
-- Two producers, one shape, both in `stage.rs`: trades from the claim atoms
-- `gross_volume_a_by_pool` already walks (it sums `amountA` away — this table
-- is that value KEPT), deposits/withdrawals from the op's own
-- `LedgerEntryChanges` (they carry no claim atoms; the op body holds the
-- caller's max/min bounds, not what actually moved).
--
-- Backfill gate (task 0279): `sum(abs(amount))` over the asset-A legs per
-- (pool, ledger) must equal `liquidity_pool_snapshots.gross_volume_a` for that
-- key — both derive from the same atoms, so one query validates the re-parse.
-- ABS, not the positive legs only: `gross_volume_a` is a GROSS figure, summing
-- each atom's A-side amount whichever way the swap went (`append_pool_claims`
-- takes `amount_sold` or `amount_bought` by canonical asset order, both
-- non-negative). A pool that only sold A that ledger has every A leg negative
-- here, and a positives-only sum would read 0 against a non-zero volume.
-- Known exception: an op crossing the SAME pool in BOTH directions nets out in
-- this table by construction (per-op grain) while `gross_volume_a` counts both
-- crossings gross, so such an op is a legitimate mismatch, not a bug.
--
-- No skip index: every read is a `pool_id` PK-prefix seek. This file is
-- FRESH-ONLY (prod is an existing DB), so the table must be CREATEd on prod
-- BEFORE the parser deploy — otherwise live ingest writes into nothing.

    --
    -- Two reasons ours stays:
    --
    -- 1. It is part of this table's ORDER BY, so it co-defines row identity
    --    for `ReplacingMergeTree` dedup. A deterministic per-tx counter is
    --    exactly what replay-idempotency needs — re-processing a ledger
    --    yields the same numbers and the merge collapses cleanly. The
    --    official key would change what counts as the same row.
    -- 2. The official key is NOT EXPRESSIBLE for much of this table. It needs
    --    an operation position, and `op_index` is absent for tx-level events
    --    (fee charge and refund, always), for every diagnostic event, and for
    --    EVERY pre-Protocol-23 event — the V3 meta carries no per-operation
    --    attribution at all. Adopting it would trade a total key for one that
    --    is null-bearing across years of history.
    --
    -- So: ours is the better INTERNAL key, theirs is the better key for
    -- exchanging data with the outside world. Different jobs, not a defect.
