//! ClickHouse writer module — populates the 17 production-schema
//! tables from parser output.
//!
//! Architecture (task 0206, hybrid-surrogate redesign):
//!
//! * [`stage::prepare`] — synchronous pre-write transform. Reads the
//!   same `Extracted*` slices PG does and produces CH-shaped row
//!   structs from [`rows`]. FK columns use a **hybrid key strategy**:
//!   three high-fan-out hubs (`accounts`, `soroban_contracts`,
//!   `transactions`) carry a deterministic surrogate `Int64 id`
//!   derived via [`ids`] (`cityhash_102_128` lower 64 bits over the
//!   StrKey / hash), keeping referencing tables narrow; the other 12
//!   tables use natural composite keys (StrKey / hash / tuple) on
//!   their PK and reference the hubs by surrogate. Surrogates are
//!   derived synchronously from the source key, so the writer is
//!   still single-pass and fully deterministic across replays.
//!   `LowCardinality(String)` dictionary-encodes per-block-repeated
//!   StrKeys for free on the natural-key columns.
//! * [`writer::PartitionWriter`] — streams rows into long-lived
//!   `clickhouse::Insert<RowT>` handles, one per table per backfill
//!   partition. Implements the commit-marker pattern so a partial
//!   run leaves the partition resumable. See module docs for the
//!   "why per-ledger inserts are wrong" rationale.
//! * [`persist_ledger_clickhouse`] — thin wrapper around a one-shot
//!   `PartitionWriter` (open → write_ledger → commit). Kept for
//!   legacy / single-ledger callers (tests, the runner's
//!   `Sink::persist_ledger` fallback). Production backfill drives
//!   `PartitionWriter` directly via the runner's partition-writer
//!   lifecycle.
