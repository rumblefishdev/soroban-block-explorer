//! Synchronous pre-write transform from parser `Extracted*` slices to
//! CH-shaped row structs in [`super::rows`].
//!
//! ## Design — hybrid surrogate / natural keys
//!
//! Three high-cardinality FK hubs (`accounts`, `soroban_contracts`,
//! `transactions`) carry surrogate `id: Int64` derived via
//! [`super::ids`] (`cityhash64(natural_key)`, deterministic). All FK
//! columns pointing at these tables are `Int64` referencing those
//! ids. Cheaper joins, smaller storage, faster scans vs natural-key
//! everywhere — see `ids.rs` module docs for the why.
//!
//! Other tables (`assets`, `nfts`, `liquidity_pools`,
//! `liquidity_pool_snapshots`, `operations_appearances`,
//! `transaction_participants`, `nft_ownership`, `lp_positions`,
//! `account_balances_current`) keep natural / composite primary
//! keys where they're already cheap.
//!
//! ## Three structural differences from PG path
//!
//! 1. **`soroban_events` is unfolded** per ADR 0044 §Decision §4a —
//!    one CH row per `ExtractedEvent` (vs PG's per-`(contract, tx,
//!    ledger)` fold).
//! 2. **`Decimal128(7)` scaling happens here.** Parser emits decimal
//!    strings or i64 stroops; CH RowBinary expects underlying `i128`
//!    scaled by 10⁷ (1 stroop = 1 i128 unit).
//! 3. **Stub-rowing for `soroban_contracts`.** Pass 2 emits NULL-rich
//!    rows for contracts referenced by events/ops/invocations but
//!    not deployed in this batch. Mirrors PG `write::upsert_contracts_
//!    returning_id` Pass 2 — keeps mid-stream backfill ranges
//!    JOIN-able even without preceding history.
//!
//! ## Trustline removal handling
//!
//! Parser-emitted `removed_trustlines` are translated to a unified
//! `BalanceRow` with `amount = 0` and current ledger as
//! `last_updated_ledger`. `ReplacingMergeTree(last_updated_ledger)`
//! keeps the zero-balance row (newest version wins). Read-time
//! convention: `WHERE amount > 0` to recover "active trustlines"
//! semantics.
