//! Row structs for the CH writer — production schema (hybrid: surrogate
//! `id Int64` on the three high-cardinality FK hubs, natural / composite
//! keys elsewhere).
//!
//! One `#[derive(clickhouse::Row, serde::Serialize)]` struct per table
//! in `crates/db-clickhouse/schema/init.sql`. Column name + order
//! match `init.sql` byte-for-byte (RowBinary is positional —
//! mismatch silently corrupts every row written). Column-order
//! pinning tests in `persist/tests_cross.rs` guard against drift.
//!
//! ## Surrogate-id hubs (`accounts`, `soroban_contracts`, `transactions`)
//!
//! Each carries `id: i64` derived deterministically via
//! [`super::ids`] (`cityhash64(natural_key)`). FK columns in 10+
//! downstream tables are `Int64` referencing these `id`s. See `ids.rs`
//! module docs for the why-this-three-tables rationale.
//!
//! ## Natural / composite keys (everything else)
//!
//! `assets`, `nfts`, `liquidity_pools`, `lp_positions`,
//! `liquidity_pool_snapshots`, `operations_appearances`,
//! `transaction_participants`, `nft_ownership` — composite ORDER BY
//! over already-cheap-shape columns (FixedString(32) hashes,
//! low-cardinality codes, Int64 FK references).
//!
//! ## Type translation
//!
//! - `Int64` → `i64`
//! - `Int32` → `i32`
//! - `Int16` → `i16`
//! - `Bool` → `bool`
//! - `String` (incl. `LowCardinality(String)`) → `String`
//! - `Nullable(String)` (incl. LC-wrapped) → `Option<String>`
//! - `FixedString(32)` → `[u8; 32]`
//! - `Nullable(FixedString(32))` → `Option<[u8; 32]>`
//! - `Decimal128(7)` → `i128` (scaled by 10⁷, matches PG `NUMERIC(28,7)`)
//! - `Nullable(Decimal128(7))` → `Option<i128>`
//! - `DateTime64(3, 'UTC')` → `i64` ms since Unix epoch
