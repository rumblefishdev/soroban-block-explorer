//! `Balance change` on the account transaction list (task 0540) — how much the
//! account **in context** received and spent on each transaction.
//!
//! The figure is relative to one account: the same transaction seen from two
//! accounts shows two different numbers, and that is the point. It is why the
//! column lives on the account page alone and never on the global transaction
//! list, the ledger page or the asset page (T07) — a balance change with
//! nobody to ask the question is exactly what the retired `net_settled` column
//! got wrong.
//!
//! ## Where the numbers come from
//!
//! `asset_transfers` holds ONE ROW PER TOKEN MOVEMENT — an edge (`from`, `to`,
//! asset, amount), not a per-transaction aggregate. The account page already
//! holds `(ledger_sequence, application_order)` for its page after step 2 of
//! [`super::queries::fetch_transactions`], and that pair is the table's sort-key
//! prefix, so this is a seek, not a scan.
//!
//! Three things the read cannot drop:
//!
//! 1. **Dedup is mandatory.** `asset_transfers` is a `ReplacingMergeTree` with
//!    no version column, and production tables in this project carry unmerged
//!    duplicates permanently (task 0420). The inner `GROUP BY` over the FULL
//!    sort key collapses them; without it a duplicated row doubles the amount
//!    on screen. (`FINAL` also works and measured faster locally — on ONE part,
//!    which flatters it. Left as the explicit group-by until it is measured on
//!    real production parts.)
//! 2. **The partition prune.** `PARTITION BY intDiv(ledger_sequence, 500000)`
//!    — without the matching `intDiv(...) IN (…)` the key filter alone does not
//!    prune.
//! 3. **A transfer to self nets to zero.** `to − from` per row, not a
//!    first-match branch: with `from_id = to_id = account` both legs fire and
//!    cancel. That is the correct answer, not a defect.
//!
//! ## What `NULL` means, and what an empty list means
//!
//! `amount` is `NULL` for exactly one reason: a **non-fungible** movement,
//! where no amount exists by nature (the event payload carries a `{token_id}`,
//! not a value). It is a complete statement about what happened, not a gap in
//! our data — so it is carried as [`BalanceChange::nft_delta`] (signed count of
//! pieces, `+` received / `−` sent) with `amount = None`, and must never render
//! as `0`. The piece's own identity is NOT in this table; `nfts` /
//! `nft_ownership` are the source for "which piece".
//!
//! An empty list, by contrast, is always a measurement: this account's
//! balances did not change. That holds because `asset_transfers` covers every
//! indexed transaction — proven on the whole ingested range by task 0540's
//! completion gate (every token event an edge or a counted reject, archive
//! re-decodes identical, 4 621 per-account sums equal raw ledger state). Until
//! that gate passed, a ledger floor made the API answer "not indexed" below the
//! backfilled range; it was removed once the range was complete. **The
//! invariant it guarded is now a rule for backfills, not code:** a pass that
//! adds transactions must write `asset_transfers` in the same pass
//! (`docs/backfills.md`), or an empty list here would claim a measurement
//! nobody made.

/// The per-transaction, per-asset signed sum for one account.
///
/// `to − from` per deduplicated edge, summed per (transaction, asset).
/// `HAVING` drops assets that net to nothing: under a column called
/// `Balance change`, an asset whose balance did not change is not one. It is
/// also what makes the adversarial row readable — a six-hop arbitrage nets
/// exactly zero in eight assets and profits in one, and the profit is the
/// whole content of the row.
///
/// **Order is the order the movements happened in**, `min((op_index,
/// event_pos_in_op))` — the position of an asset's FIRST edge inside the
/// transaction. It is a fact the chain supplies, and the only ordering
/// available that is one: assets have different decimals and different prices,
/// so ranking them by amount would be comparing quantities that are not
/// comparable, and we have no prices to make them so (nothing in ClickHouse
/// carries one). An earlier version ranked by scaled magnitude and was dropped
/// for exactly that reason.
///
/// **Non-fungible movements group by their NEW OWNER** (`nft_owner`, the
/// edge's `to_id`; `NULL` for a burn, and `NULL` throughout for a fungible
/// asset so those still aggregate per asset). That is what lets a bulk move be
/// listed piece by piece: `nft_ownership` records the new owner, so the group's
/// `(collection, transaction, owner)` names the exact set of pieces that moved,
/// and its own count verifies the set before any of it is shown.
///
/// It has to be the owner rather than the event position, which was measured
/// and does not work: `nft_ownership.event_order` is `0` on every row of a
/// ten-piece transfer, so nothing there pairs one piece with one edge.
///
/// **Fungible and non-fungible movements of the SAME asset are separate rows**
/// — `is_non_fungible` is part of the grouping key. `asset_id` is the EMITTING
/// CONTRACT's surrogate, so one contract that emits both an `{amount}` and a
/// `{token_id}` transfer shares an id between them; without the split,
/// ClickHouse's `sum()` (which skips NULLs) would return a real `delta`
/// alongside a non-zero `nft_delta` on one row. The cell branches on "is there
/// an amount", so the piece movement would vanish — and if the fungible legs
/// happened to net out, the row would survive `HAVING` and print `0` for a
/// transaction that changed an owner. Splitting makes the DTO's invariant true
/// by construction: an entry is fungible or non-fungible, never both.
///
/// Extracted so its load-bearing clauses are assertable without a live
/// ClickHouse: the self-transfer subtraction, the RMT dedup, the partition
/// prune and the non-fungible split are each one word away from a regression
/// that review does not catch.
