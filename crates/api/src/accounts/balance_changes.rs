//! `Balance change` on the account transaction list (task 0540) — how much the
//! account **in context** received and spent on each transaction.
//!
//! The figure is relative to one account: the same transaction seen from two
//! accounts shows two different numbers, and that is the point. It is why the
//! column lives on the account page alone and never on the global transaction
//! list, the ledger page or the asset page (T07) — a balance change with
//! nobody to ask the question is exactly what the retired `net_settled` column
//! got wrong.
//!
//! ## Where the numbers come from
//!
//! `asset_transfers` holds ONE ROW PER TOKEN MOVEMENT — an edge (`from`, `to`,
//! asset, amount), not a per-transaction aggregate. The account page already
//! holds `(ledger_sequence, application_order)` for its page after step 2 of
//! [`super::queries::fetch_transactions`], and that pair is the table's sort-key
//! prefix, so this is a seek, not a scan.
//!
//! Three things the read cannot drop:
//!
//! 1. **Dedup is mandatory.** `asset_transfers` is a `ReplacingMergeTree` with
//!    no version column, and production tables in this project carry unmerged
//!    duplicates permanently (task 0420). The inner `GROUP BY` over the FULL
//!    sort key collapses them; without it a duplicated row doubles the amount
//!    on screen. (`FINAL` also works and measured faster locally — on ONE part,
//!    which flatters it. Left as the explicit group-by until it is measured on
//!    real production parts.)
//! 2. **The partition prune.** `PARTITION BY intDiv(ledger_sequence, 500000)`
//!    — without the matching `intDiv(...) IN (…)` the key filter alone does not
//!    prune.
//! 3. **A transfer to self nets to zero.** `to − from` per row, not a
//!    first-match branch: with `from_id = to_id = account` both legs fire and
//!    cancel. That is the correct answer, not a defect.
//!
//! ## What `NULL` means, and what an empty list means
//!
//! `amount` is `NULL` for exactly one reason: a **non-fungible** movement,
//! where no amount exists by nature (the event payload carries a `{token_id}`,
//! not a value). It is a complete statement about what happened, not a gap in
//! our data — so it is carried as [`BalanceChange::nft_delta`] (signed count of
//! pieces, `+` received / `−` sent) with `amount = None`, and must never render
//! as `0`. The piece's own identity is NOT in this table; `nfts` /
//! `nft_ownership` are the source for "which piece".
//!
//! Separately, and far more consequential today: below
//! [`VALUE_FLOW_FLOOR_LEDGER`] the table holds NO rows at all, which looks
//! exactly like a transaction that moved nothing. The API therefore returns
//! `None` (not an empty list) for those transactions, so the frontend can say
//! "not indexed" instead of drawing a zero that is not a measurement.
