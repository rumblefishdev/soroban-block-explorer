//! ClickHouse queries for the assets endpoints (task 0243).
//!
//! Returns the `AssetRow` shape, so
//! the handler stays backend-agnostic after the fetch. Assets are addressed by
//! the composite identity (contract StrKey / `CODE-ISSUER` / the reserved
//! `native` token); the numeric surrogate was dropped (PR #175), and CH keys
//! `assets` on `(asset_type, asset_code, issuer_id, contract_id)` with no
//! surrogate at all.
//!
//! Notable CH-vs-PG divergences:
//!
//! - **`asset_family_name()` is a PG SQL function.** CH has no equivalent,
//!   so the `asset_type` → label mapping is done in Rust ([`asset_type_name`]),
//!   identical to the PG migration `20260422000000_enum_label_functions`.
//! - **`assets a FINAL`** collapses re-ingested asset versions (ReplacingMergeTree
//!   keyed on the 4-tuple). The `soroban_contracts` lookup join carries no FINAL
//!   — the identity columns it projects (contract StrKey, `deployed_at_ledger`)
//!   are write-once / stable across versions. The `accounts` table is NOT joined
//!   (task 0319 for the list, task 0334 for the detail): a full `accounts` hash
//!   side (~18M rows) was the dominant read cost. The issuer is resolved by a
//!   separate `accounts.id` key-seek instead. `home_domain` IS mutable
//!   (SET_OPTIONS), so the seek picks the latest version
//!   (`ORDER BY last_seen_ledger DESC LIMIT 1`); a 16M-row `accounts FINAL`
//!   would be ruinous.
//! - **`nullIf(...)` on the joined columns** (contract_id → `nullIf(_, '')`,
//!   deployed_at_ledger → `nullIf(_, 0)`) makes a LEFT-JOIN miss decode as
//!   `None`. We do NOT use `SETTINGS join_use_nulls = 1` — the `api_reader` CH
//!   user runs under `readonly = 1` (RBAC profile `read_only`), which rejects
//!   per-query setting overrides. Same convention as stkrolikiewicz's CH modules
//!   (accounts `fetch_balances`, LP). The issuer StrKey / home_domain are emptied
//!   to `None` in Rust ([`list_row_to_asset_row`]), not via `nullIf`.
//! - **Cursor** is the composite `AssetKeyCursor`; its keyset clause is only
//!   present on continuation pages, so the clickhouse 0.15 "None bound into a
//!   tuple keyset returns 0 rows" defect is sidestepped (the bound values are
//!   always real). The free-text `asset_code` filter and the cursor values are
//!   `.bind()`-ed (user-controlled); `asset_type` is interpolated (typed `i16`).
//!
//! `/transactions` (canonical 10) keys on the datasource-tagged `TxListCursor`
//! (`Ch { ledger_sequence, tiebreak }`), mirroring the accounts sub-resource. It
//! seeks the `operation_asset_appearances` fan-out on its `asset_id`-leading PK
//! (task 0359) — a bounded PK-prefix range read behind the `max(sequence)` commit
//! fence, so a hot asset early-terminates near the tip and a rare asset stays a
//! bounded seek, replacing the old NON-leading identity-predicate density-scan
//! over `operations_appearances` (ORDER BY `ledger_sequence`) that walked back by
//! descending ledger until the page filled.
