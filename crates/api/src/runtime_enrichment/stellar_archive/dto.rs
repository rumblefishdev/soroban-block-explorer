//! DTOs for XDR-sourced fields, composed with DB-sourced light slices to
//! produce final E3/E14 endpoint responses.
//!
//! Per ADR 0027 Part III + ADR 0029 + ADR 0033: the DB stores identity and
//! index columns; event, memo, signature, and envelope detail lives only on
//! the public Stellar archive. For E14 this means the entire event payload
//! (type, topics, data, event index) is S3-sourced — there is no DB-side
//! event row to merge against. E3 still carries its DB tx-light slice and
//! composes it with an XDR heavy struct via `merge_e3_response`.
