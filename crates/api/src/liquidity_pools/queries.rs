//!   decimal strings, sidestepping the clickhouse-rs Decimal decode gotcha.
//! - **`pool_id`** is a `FixedString(32)`; the wire/hex form is the 64-char
//!   lowercase hex. SQL compares with `pool_id = unhex(?)` and reads back
//!   `lower(hex(pool_id))`.
//! - **`created_at_ledger`** does NOT exist on CH `liquidity_pools` (dropped,
//!   see schema header) — derived as `min(ledger_sequence)` over the pool's
//!   snapshots, falling back to `last_updated_ledger` for a pool that somehow
//!   has no snapshot yet.
//! - **snapshot `created_at`** does NOT exist on CH `liquidity_pool_snapshots`
//!   (only `ledger_sequence`) — the latest-snapshot timestamp is derived from
//!   the joined `ledgers.closed_at`.
//! - The freshness window (PG: `snapshots.created_at >= NOW() - 7d`) is NOT
//!   applied on the detail/list latest-snapshot pick yet — detail takes the
//!   single latest snapshot regardless of age (matches the "latest known
//!   state" intent); a staleness cutoff is a follow-up if parity needs it.

// 1h + 1d only — the 1w chart interval joins the DAILY series.
//
// Two deliberate traps documented in the task
// (notes/R-prices-freeze-incident-and-current-price-usd-v13.md):
// - never join raw `prices.assets` (153 empty-code rows silently price
//   native legs as an arbitrary asset);
// - never decode a `prices.*` view positionally / via `SELECT *` — the
//   views grow additively (current_price_usd went 6 → 13 columns).
//
// LEFT JOIN misses surface as DEFAULT values, not NULL (`join_use_nulls`
// is rejected for the readonly API user — CH gotcha list), so every read
// wraps the price in `nullIf(price, 0)`.
//
// The views do NOT guarantee `close_usd > 0`: a bucket whose only candles
// carry zero volume can publish `Decimal128::MIN` (≈ -1.7e24) instead of
// omitting the row (prices-side 0171, confirmed by the owner 2026-08-11).
// A negative close would print a -1e24-scale TVL and, through the chart's
// ASOF carry-forward, smear it over every later bucket — so every
// `close_usd` read here filters `close_usd > 0` itself and treats
// non-positive rows as absent.
//
// USD arithmetic is Float64, rounded to cents. The analytics carry a 1%
// verification tolerance by design (task AC); Float64 keeps the SQL free
// of Decimal128×Decimal128 scale-overflow (7+14 fractional digits).
// **Every money value is formatted by [`usd_str`] on the Rust side** — SQL
// returns raw Float64. CH's `toString(round(x, 2))` emits "25" / "0" /
// "1.5" (variable decimals), which would put the chart and the detail
// endpoint on two different wire shapes for the same field.
//
// **Bounded price carry-forward.** A price bucket exists only once the
// asset trades in it, so the in-progress bucket is routinely missing for an
// illiquid leg — an exact bucket-equality join then NULLs the newest chart
// point, the one users read as "current". Reads therefore take the most
// recent close at or before the wanted bucket (CH `ASOF LEFT JOIN`), but
// only within [`MAX_PRICE_CARRY_SECONDS`]. Unbounded carry-forward would be
// worse than a hole: it would paint the 2026-07-21..08-03 provider freeze

    // the boundary (ADR 0051), so `soroban_contracts` is not consulted at all.

    // writes exactly one deterministic row per `(pool_id, ledger_sequence)`, so
    // `FINAL` is redundant for dedup; dropping it turns the read into a bounded
    // reverse-PK seek (`ORDER BY ledger_sequence DESC LIMIT 1`) instead of a
    // whole-table merge. It stays a whole-row `LIMIT 1` (not per-column
    // `argMax`), so `reserve_a`/`reserve_b` can never tear across a stale
    // before/after pair in the pre-cleanup window. `created_at_ledger` already
    // reads without `FINAL` (`min(ledger_sequence)` is dup-invariant).

///   `from`/`to` API contract (RFC3339 timestamps) is preserved unchanged
///   rather than switched to the ledger-bound form the reference SQL used.
/// - **`pool_id = unhex(?)`** is a leading-PK seek on
///   `liquidity_pool_snapshots` (`ORDER BY (pool_id, ledger_sequence)`), so
///   the scan is bounded to this pool's snapshots — box-measured 14.5 M rows
///   / 237 MB for the hottest pool (1.84 M snapshots) over a 90-day 1d window.
///
/// USD semantics (per bucket):
/// - **TVL** is a state quantity — the last snapshot in the bucket whose
///   own price bucket is priced: `reserve_a·close_usd_a + reserve_b·close_usd_b`.
///   NULL unless BOTH legs price (a one-leg TVL silently halves the pool).
///   `argMaxIf(…, isNotNull(tvl_row))` deliberately falls back to the last
///   PRICEABLE snapshot in the bucket (≤ one bucket of intra-bucket
///   staleness) instead of NULLing the bucket on a missing tip price.
/// - **volume** is a flow quantity — `sum(gross_volume_a × close_usd_a)`,
///   each ledger priced at its OWN price bucket. If any swap row in the
///   bucket lacks a leg-A price the bucket's volume is NULL (an honest
///   hole), never a silent partial sum. `sum()` over an all-NULL bucket
///   (no swaps) yields NULL (box-confirmed), matching the PG contract.
///   NOTE: the veto is all-or-nothing per bucket, so at `1w` a single
///   unpriced ledger discards the week — deliberate for now (an unmarked
///   partial sum reads as a real number), revisit with a coverage field.
/// - **fee_revenue** is derived in Rust from `volume` ([`fee_revenue_usd`]).
///
/// Prices join (contract: prices views.sql, pinned 2026-06-16):
/// - Grain follows the interval: `1h` → `prices.price_usd_series_1h` on
///   `toStartOfHour(closed_at)`; `1d`/`1w` → `prices.price_usd_series` on
///   `toStartOfDay(closed_at)` (weekly candles are not provided — a 1w
///   bucket's TVL prices at its last snapshot's DAY).
/// - **`ASOF LEFT JOIN` on `price.bucket <= ledger.price_bucket`**, capped
///   at [`MAX_PRICE_CARRY_SECONDS`]: a candle exists only once the asset
///   trades in that bucket, so exact equality left the newest point of
///   every illiquid-leg pool NULL (box-reproduced). ASOF needs an equi-join
///   column, hence the constant `k` on both sides — a real column, not the
///   `ON 1 = 1` form that pins the join algorithm to `hash`. The
///   subqueries' lower bound is widened by the same cap so the FIRST bucket
///   can carry forward too.
/// - The staleness cap is what keeps carry-forward honest: without it the
///   2026-07-21..08-03 provider freeze would render as live TVL priced off
///   a 12-day-old candle.
/// - Identity + bucket-range predicates live INSIDE the right-side
///   subqueries: the bucket range is what bounds the view's scan of
///   `price_ohlcv_*` (their header's pushdown note); one identity per side
///   keeps the hash tables at ≤ one row per bucket.
/// - A join miss yields DEFAULT (epoch `bucket`, `0` close), not NULL
///   (`join_use_nulls` is rejected for the readonly user) — the staleness
///   test rejects it, since an epoch bucket is always further back than the
///   cap. `nullIf(close_usd, 0)` guards the priced-but-zero case; the views
///   already filter `close_usd > 0`.
/// - The **in-progress price bucket is excluded** (`least(to, grain(now))`).
///   It is only partly enriched, so its weighted close can be a dust print —
///   see [`fetch_last_closes`] for the measured case and the prices owner's
///   confirmation. The ASOF carry then prices the newest chart bucket off
///   the last CLOSED price bucket, which is exactly what the carry is for.
