//! `assets.id` surrogate -> the identity a page can render.
//!
//! The fourth instantiation of the id-IN resolver pattern (tasks 0344 / 0345)
//! and the first one shared: `resolve_accounts` and `resolve_contracts` each
//! map a surrogate to ONE StrKey, while an asset needs its whole identity —
//! family, code, issuer, contract, symbol, decimals. Task 0540 wrote this for
//! the account value-flow read; task 0374 needs the same resolution for
//! liquidity-pool legs, which is the "third consumer needing richer fields"
//! that the domain map held the consolidation behind.
//!
//! It is shared rather than copied because the statement below is not obvious
//! code — every shape in it is a paid-for lesson, and a second copy would drift
//! away from them one edit at a time:
//!
//! 1. The `assets` join is LEFT, or every NFT collection's transfers vanish.
//! 2. The contract leg keys on the SAME id list, not through
//!    `assets.contract_id` — that shape ran the scan-only `assets` leg twice
//!    (209 ms / 2.5M rows against 44 ms / 268k).
//! 3. `toBool(...)`, because a bare comparison is `UInt8` on the wire and the
//!    driver wants CH `Bool` — the mismatch class that took account detail down.
//! 4. `CAST(… AS Array(Int64))`, because ClickHouse types an array literal from
//!    its values and an all-positive page yields `Array(UInt64)` — a 500 on
//!    exactly those accounts and no others.
//! 5. `LIMIT 1 BY id` / `argMax(…, version)` instead of `FINAL`, measured at
//!    4.7x fewer rows.
//!
//! The output is the RAW identity. Each consumer projects it into its own wire
//! shape (the account read builds a `CODE-ISSUER` link, a pool leg builds an
//! avatar) — that projection is a surface concern and stays with the surface.
