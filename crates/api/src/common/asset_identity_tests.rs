/// An empty code is native XLM's real, stored identity — not a missing value —
/// and native has a deployed SAC. An `asset_code != ''` guard was added
/// deliberately in `a19ac8f6` to match Postgres, which returned NULL there;
/// Postgres is retired and `/v1/assets/native` publishes that same SAC, so the
/// guard left one asset describing itself two ways depending on the endpoint.
///
/// Pinned on the module source because the statements are inline string
/// literals — there is no builder to call. That is the honest limit of this
/// guard: it catches the exact regression (a re-added `!= ''` on an asset code)
/// and nothing subtler. A behavioural test needs the statements extracted
/// first, which is recorded as an acceptance criterion on 0470.
///
/// It used to scan `liquidity_pools/queries.rs` for `asset_a_code != ''`. Task
/// 0374 moved every leg identity read into THIS module and deleted those
/// columns, at which point the guard was scanning a file that could no longer
/// contain its subject — a test that cannot fail, reading as coverage.
