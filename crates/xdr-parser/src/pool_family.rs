//! The single seam for Soroban pool-family state writes (task 0518,
//! decision 4a).
//!
//! Every AMM family contributes ledger-entry-derived pool state through ONE
//! collection of [`PoolFamilyWrite`] values instead of a parallel slice per
//! family. Adding a family is a new variant + a new arm at the two ends
//! (extraction here, staging in `db-clickhouse`), not a new field threaded
//! through every pipeline struct in between.
