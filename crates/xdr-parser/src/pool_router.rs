//! Router-registry pool discovery — decoding `add_pool` events (task 0374).
//!
//! # Scope: one discovery mechanism, not every AMM
//!
//! This covers the **router-registry** family only. A router contract announces
//! each new pool with `add_pool`, and emitting one **is** what makes a contract
//! a router — 10 contracts on mainnet do, all of one protocol family, together
//! registering 497 pools (count taken 2026-08-27; the registry is live and this
//! number moves).
//!
//! It does **not** cover AMMs that have no router registry. Soroswap pairs, for
//! instance, announce themselves — `("SoroswapPair", "deposit")` — with no
//! registry event anywhere, so they need their own discovery entirely
//! (task 0518, and blocked on 0517 because their event name sits in topic 1).
//!
//! Per-protocol decoding is not a design preference: Soroban defines no AMM
//! standard, so each protocol names and lays out its events differently and
//! there is nothing universal to decode. What *is* shared — the pool model,
//! the leg list, reserve storage, the position shape — is shared (task 0516);
//! reading events is the only place the chain forces a difference.
//! Classic protocol pools are not contracts at all and never reach here.
//!
//! **Shape-driven, never address-driven.** Nothing here matches a contract
//! address: the vendor documents one router, and keying on that address
//! silently drops ~6 % of live pools — see the verification pass in task 0374.
//!
//! # Payload — from the vendor's own source, not inferred
//!
//! `liquidity_pool_router/src/events.rs` publishes:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! self.env().events().publish(
//!     (Symbol::new(self.env(), "add_pool"), tokens),       // topics
//!     (pool_address, pool_type, subpool_salt, init_args),  // data
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! which reaches us as ScVal JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! topics = [ {sym "add_pool"}, {vec [ {address token}, … ]} ]
//! data   = {vec [ {address pool_address},
//!                 {sym pool_type},
//!                 {bytes subpool_salt},
//!                 {vec [ {u32 fee}, … ]} ]}
//! ```
//!
//! Corroboration, 2026-08-27: the vendor repository is unreachable (404 on
//! every branch and through the API), so the snippet above comes from an
//! archived capture (research 0008, fetched 2026-03-27) and **cannot be
//! re-confirmed at source today**. Two independent checks stand in for it: the
//! deployed contract's own spec, pulled from chain, agrees on every part it
//! covers — `pool_type` really is a `Symbol`, and the `BytesN<32>` really is
//! the router's pool lookup key. Note the spec carries **no event definitions
//! at all**, so an event's shape can only ever be confirmed by source or by
//! observation; there is no third route.
//!
//! Structural conformance measured 2026-08-27: **497 of 497** `add_pool`
//! events in all history match this shape, across all ten emitting contracts,
//! with pool types drawn from one vocabulary. No false positives exist today —
//! but the shape is the only guard, so a contract using the name for something
//! else with the same layout would be accepted. Behaviour confirms what the
//! registry only claims: 23 registrations from five dead deployments have
//! never emitted a single pool event, so a caller should treat a registration
//! as a candidate and let activity confirm it.
//!
//! **The leg list is a list.** Measured across all registrations: 488 pools
//! carry two legs, 7 carry three, and **2 carry four** — all `stable`. Treating
//! legs as a pair is the classic-AMM assumption that does not survive here, and
//! an upper bound of three would not survive either. No bound is assumed.
