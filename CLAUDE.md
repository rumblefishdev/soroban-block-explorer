## Session Gate

**Before any work, verify:**

| Check | File | If Missing |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Who** | `lore/0-session/current-user.md` | Auto-generated from `LORE_SESSION_CURRENT_USER` env |
| **What** | `lore/0-session/current-task.md` | Pick from `lore/0-session/next-tasks.md`, use MCP tool `lore_set-task` |

## File Deletion Policy

**Using `rm` is FORBIDDEN.** To delete files, move them to `.trash/` instead:
```bash
mv <file> .trash/
```

## Task-Gated Development

**Writing code without an active task is FORBIDDEN.**

## API Types Codegen — regenerate before commit

If a PR touches **any of these paths**, the OpenAPI spec changes and the
TypeScript types in `libs/api-types/src/{openapi.json,generated/}` MUST
be regenerated before commit (CI gate `API types freshness`):

- `crates/api/**` (handlers, DTOs, openapi schemas, routes)
- `Cargo.toml` / `Cargo.lock`
- `libs/api-types/**`

Command:

```bash
npx nx run @rumblefish/api-types:generate
```

This runs `cargo run -p api --bin extract_openapi > libs/api-types/src/openapi.json`
followed by `openapi-ts` codegen. Stage the resulting changes (`openapi.json` +
`generated/*`) in the same commit as the API change.

CI runs `nx run @rumblefish/api-types:check-generated` (a `git diff --exit-code`
on those paths). Skipping the regen → red `API types freshness` check.

## Evergreen Architecture Docs

Per [ADR 0032](./lore/2-adrs/0032_docs-architecture-evergreen-maintenance.md),
every PR that changes the shape of the system MUST also update the relevant
files under `docs/architecture/**` in the same PR. "Shape of the system" means
anything describable in those docs: schema (column types, tables, partitioning,
constraints), API endpoints (added/removed/renamed), ingestion pipeline steps,
infrastructure topology, XDR parsing responsibilities, frontend data contracts.

The ADR template (`lore/2-adrs/_template.md`) and task template
(`lore/1-tasks/_template.md`) both carry a "Docs updated" checklist — use it.
Mark each doc file either "updated" or `N/A — reason`; never leave it blank.

Pure policy / process / tooling changes (e.g. CI configuration) that do not
affect the described architecture are legitimate `N/A` cases.

# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `pnpm nx build`, `npm exec nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax
