 * Target = lastClose + 1.5 × cadence: one cadence to reach the next block,

 * that maximises the symmetric margin against ledger-close jitter, so it
 * minimises both empty fetches (0 new blocks) and double catches (2 blocks
 * in one fetch). Latency is deliberately traded away for that margin.
 *
 * `delay = 1.5 × cadence − elapsedSinceClose`, clamped to [MIN, MAX]. The
 * subtraction self-corrects with no stored state: a late block keeps the
 * same `closedAt` while wall-clock advances, so `elapsed` grows, the delay
 * shrinks toward MIN, and the feed rechecks sooner until the block lands
 * and `closedAt` jumps — re-anchoring the phase on the real ledger clock.
 * Uses the client clock for "now"; sub-second skew is irrelevant at this
 * cadence and latency is not a goal. This only *approaches* a clean 1:1 —
 * with non-zero close jitter some 0/2 fetches are unavoidable (a client
 * cannot know future arrivals); a true 1:1 needs server push (SSE/WS),
 * out of scope on the Lambda-only backend.
