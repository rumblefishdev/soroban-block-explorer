 * SEP-2 federated addresses, resolved in the browser.

 * Forward (`type=name`): `karol*lobstr.co` → `G…`, for the search box.
 * The reverse direction (`type=id`, for the account page) ships separately
 * with PR #440 on feat/0443_sep2-federated-addresses.
 *
 * Both hops are public GETs that serve `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
 * (SEP-1 requires it for `stellar.toml`, and federation servers follow), so
 * the API never issues the request — which is the whole reason this is cheap.
 * The domain is attacker-controlled in the ordinary case, so a server-side
 * version would carry an SSRF surface; here the request leaves the user's own
 * browser and our infrastructure is not in the path at all. See task 0443.
 *
 * The trade that buys: the domain learns the viewer's IP and which account
 * they are looking at. `no-referrer` keeps our origin and path out of it, but
 * the IP is inherent to the browser making the call — accepted deliberately,
 * not overlooked.

 * Against SEP-2 verbatim: the username is "printable UTF-8 with whitespace
 * and the following characters excluded: `*`, `>`" — hence `[^*\s>]`, which
 * keeps the `@` of an email and the `+` of an E.164 phone number, both of
 * which the spec lists as valid names. Unicode letters are matched so an
 * internationalized domain (`münchen.de`) classifies; `fetch` converts it to
 * punycode itself.
 *
 * Deliberately STRICTER than the spec in one place: SEP-2 allows "any valid
 * RFC 1035 domain name", which includes single-label names like `localhost`.
 * Those are rejected — this regex is the gate on spending two network
 * round-trips, and a dotless string is far more likely to be someone's search
 * term than an anchor domain.
