 * Resolve the cross-entity link target for a pool asset leg (task 0263).
 * Always routes to the asset detail page — backend `parse_asset_id`
 * accepts either the SAC C-strkey or a `code-issuer` composite, so both
 * classic and SAC legs resolve to the same asset row.
 *
 * Precedence:
 *   1. `asset_type_name === 'native'` (native XLM) → `/assets/native`. The reserved
 *      `native` literal IS the canonical asset token (task 0243) — the older
 *      "native has no on-chain address, so no link" rule predates it and left
 *      XLM as the only unlinkable leg in the app, while account balances,
 *      search and the SAC chip all route there (task 0472).
 *   2. `asset_code` + `issuer` (classic credit) → `/assets/${code}-${issuer}`.
 *      Preferred over the SAC C-address ON PURPOSE: task 0364 dropped the
 *      SAC-facet aliasing arm from `fetch_by_contract_id` (asset_type is
 *      pinned to 3), so `/assets/{SAC C…}` 404s — verified against the API
 *      2026-08-13. The earlier contract_id-first order sent ~93k classic
 *      legs to a dead page.
 *   3. `contract_id` → `/assets/${contract_id}`. Only reachable when the
 *      code/issuer pair is incomplete; resolves for a genuine Soroban token
 *      contract, 404s for a bare SAC address — a best-effort last resort.
 *   4. Anything else (schema drift) → no link.
