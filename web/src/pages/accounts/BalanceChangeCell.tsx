/**
 * `Balance change` cell — what one transaction did to THE ACCOUNT WHOSE PAGE
 * THIS IS (task 0540). The figure is account-relative by construction: the same
 * transaction opened from another account shows different numbers, which is why
 * this column exists here and nowhere else. Its predecessor put a number with no
 * account behind it on the global list, and that is exactly what made it wrong.
 *
 * Three states the API keeps apart, and so must this cell:
 *
 * | `changes`  | Means                                    | Renders        |
 * | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- |
 * | `null`     | below the index floor — NOT MEASURED      | `Not indexed`  |
 * | `[]`       | measured; NO TOKEN moved for this account | `0`            |
 * | non-empty  | measured; these assets moved              | signed amounts |
 *
 * `null` must never fall through to `0`: it is the difference between "nothing
 * moved" and "we have not looked yet", and drawing the second as the first
 * shows a value nobody measured.
 *
 * `[]` does not claim the XLM balance held: a fee is charged whatever happens,
 * and the fee is the column next door. This column is about tokens that moved.
 *
 * The header carries the meaning of the sign — a BALANCE CHANGE is a result,
 * not a transfer, so a net of two-way movement cannot be misread as a one-way
 * payment and needs no extra glyph. Assets that net to zero are already dropped
 * server-side, so `+N` counts assets that actually changed.

 * 3. **The ASSET page** for anything fungible.
 *
 * Never `/assets/C…` for a non-fungible movement: an NFT collection has no
 * `assets` row — that is the whole reason the read joins it `LEFT` — so that
 * URL answers `404` for exactly the collections this cell names.
 *
 * An asset with no link identity at all renders as plain text rather than as a
 * link that goes nowhere.
 *
 * **Not `IdentifierDisplay`**, which wraps this same `RouterLink` +
 * `contentLinkSx` pairing: it renders at weight 500 in the mono identifier
 * face, which would make the asset code louder than the amount beside it and
 * invert this cell's amount / code / count hierarchy. The shared affordance
 * this cell owes (task 0535) is the underline, and `contentLinkSx` is where
